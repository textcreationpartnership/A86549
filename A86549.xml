            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know not to whom I may better dedicate this little Treatiſe, than to your ſelves, to whom I have dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf, under Chriſt, in the work of the Goſpel, from my first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be a conſtant Preacher of the Goſpel. And I have accounted it my priviledge to ſucceed ſuch faithfull Ministers, who, for many yeares, continually inſtructed you in the wayes of holineſſe. The firſt of them
<pb facs="tcp:119718:3"/> was Doctor <hi>Baily,</hi> who preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome of you, yet living, <hi>the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Piety,</hi> which he after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. And, during the time of my continuance among you, I have not ceaſed to preach (according to my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents) the Doctrine which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to godlineſſe. As <hi>Paul</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Timothy</hi> to charge ſome, that they preach no other Doctrine; So I charge you (as having received the charge of you) that ye receive none other Doctrine, than what is according to godlineſſe. Be not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to heare ſuch, as bring contrary Doctrine: run not with men of itching eares, after ſuch as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for teaching meer Novelty: Wandring ſtarres (to which ſuch teachers are compared in Scripture) ſparkle more than the fixed starres of greateſt magnitude. And one Comet, or Blazing ſtarre (though it portend miſchief) is more wondred at, than all the Starres of Heaven, yea, than the Sun in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb facs="tcp:119718:3"/> But be you carefull, with the wiſe men, to follow ſuch ſtarres, whoſe motion tends to the place where your Saviour is. And although you finde him here, not clad in ſoft rayment, nor deckt with tapeſtry, but, as in his infancy, laid in ſtraw; yet think not much to bow down and worſhip him, and offer your gifts, your whole ſelves, <hi>ſpirit, ſoule and body,</hi> (of far greater value than <hi>gold, frankincenſe, and myrrhe</hi>) as due to him, who offered his ſoule a ſacrifice for you.</p>
            <p>Beware of being intangled with the profits and pleaſures of the world, which (as I have lately ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you) are the two great barres that hinder ſoules from coming to Chriſt. Think it not much to attend once in a week upon a Lecture ſermon. Thoſe that will not leave their ordinary worldly buſineſſe to attend upon the Word of Chriſt for one hour, when they may return to it again, will be loath to forſake all to follow Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:119718:4"/> if they ſhould be called to it: and without this you cannot be his true Diſciples. Oh be not like the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Iſraelites, that deſpiſed the heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> becauſe it fell daily at their tent doores, and luſted after fleſh. Be not like the multitude of unthankfull poore, that wax wanton in this time of plenty: Leſt the Lord, by ſending among you <hi>a famine of hearing the Word,</hi> cauſe it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>precious.</hi> But while you have the Ordinances of grace, wait dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently upon Chriſt who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of grace) in them: Pray, and labour for ſanctified hearts, and lives, conſidering that Holineſſe is your reall Happineſſe (as I have more largely taught you in theſe following Sermons.)</p>
            <p>Never feare that my preſsing you, or your preſsing on to holineſs, or good works, will in the leaſt derogate from the freeneſſe of Gods grace: for they are not your own work but Gods work in you, and by you: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:119718:4"/> by them do you adde any thing to God, but God to you: you doe not increaſe his glory, but he augments your happineſſe; ſo that what good you doe (being done in the ſtrength of <hi>his grace,</hi> and tending to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>your own ſoules,</hi> makes no Recompence to God, but makes you the greater Debtors to him. The more holy, and abundant you are in good works, the more you have received from God, and the more you owe to God. And you have no more cauſe to glory in your ſelves, <hi>for what good you do,</hi> than to glory in your ſelves <hi>for the free pardon and remiſſion of your ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons were not preached, neither are they now publiſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my unfeigned prayers to God for a bleſsing upon them to your ſoules. As I have been at the paines to compoſe, prea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HOlineſſe being the very Image of God upon the ſoule, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perfection in which we were Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the reparation whereof we are Redeemed by Chriſt, renewed by the holy Ghoſt, conducted by the Word, and furthered by all Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and in which ſo much of our everlaſting Bleſſedneſſe will conſiſt; It is no wonder if it have many Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the world; and if Satan, and all ungodly men, do imploy their wit and power to extinguiſh it; ſubtill Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſecretly undermine it, and bring in Doctrines, which if practically enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, would deſtroy it: The Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines more plainly ſlight and contemne it, and the profane do openly deride and perſecute it. No man but the Son hath ſeen God at any time, but in the glaſſe of his Word and Works muſt we here behold him: One of theſe Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is the Church, and its ſanctified Members: here do the wicked ſee the
<pb facs="tcp:119718:6"/> holineſſe of God and hate it; here do the juſt behold the holineſſe of God and love it: It is as neglecters, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of Chriſt in his holy ones, that the wicked are condemned, &amp; as lovers of Chriſt in his holy ones, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are rewarded in the judgement that is before us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. All Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practiſes therefore that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from Sanctification, do tend to Damnation, and are enmity againſt God. The uſuall wayes by which the Deceiver and his Inſtruments attempt this work, are theſe foure: 1. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the neceſſity and true ends and uſes of holineſſe, and perſwading men that it is neceſſary, no otherwiſe than as an evidence of ſome better thing, or as a point of gratitude onely for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion received: when as it is part of our ſalvation it ſelf, and a neceſſary meanes to the reſt, which yet remaineth. 2. By ſetting Juſtification and Sanctification in oppoſition, as meanes of pleaſing God, and ſaying, It is not This, but That, when it is, indeed, both This and That, and both are links of the ſame Golden chaine, inſeparably conjunct. 3. By pretending an humble abaſing of man, as if we muſt diſeſteem Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:119718:6"/> becauſe it is in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and the works of it done by our ſelves: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is <hi>our ſelves</hi> that Chriſt meaneth to cure; in <hi>our ſelves</hi> he dwelleth by faith; <hi>our ſelves</hi> are the habitation and temples of his Spirit, and it is <hi>our ſelves</hi> whom he will perfect in Glory for ever, and <hi>our ſelves</hi> by whom he will be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and honoured. Is grace the leſſe grace, becauſe it is in, or upon <hi>our ſelves?</hi> If God had thought that all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is in any beſides himſelf, or all the good that is done by any other, had been derogatory to his glory, he would never have made any creature, nor made uſe of any; or elſe he would not have made them good. Is the goodneſſe of a Watch a diſhonour to the Watchmaker? or the beauty of a Houſe diſhonourable to the Builder? Will God bring men to Heaven, and to perfection of Holineſſe, at ſo deare a rate, that we may then diſhonour him, by being perſonally perfect? They that digeſt this unhappy doctrine, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to give God the glory of his works, and particularly of this excellent part of his grace. 4. Another engine to deſtroy Sanctification, concurrent with the former, is the pretended ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<pb facs="tcp:119718:7"/> of Chriſt and Free-grace; as if Chriſt, within us, were no Chriſt, and Sanctfication were no part of Free-grace: Or as if to deny Chriſt our love and obedience were to advance and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him? Or to Love and Prayſe and obey him, were to diſhonour him. The vanity of theſe deluſory conceits, is by Reverend and deare Brother, plainly, judieiouſly and ſolidly diſcovered in this following Treatiſe, neither cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the free Remiſſion of ſins, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling mortification, and holy living, as the Papiſts; nor laying our recovery wholly in relative changes, and all our righteouſneſſe in meer reputation, as the Libertines doe, ſeeing it is by the right apprehenſions and conſiderations of the Underſtanding, that the Will muſt be rectified, and the Affections elevated; and ſound Doctrine is the meanes to ſound Apprehenſions: I may groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly perſwade thee, Reader, that by a diligent and faithfull peruſall of this Treatiſe, thou art likely to receive an addition to thy Sanctification, while thou ſhalt read and conſider of its Excellency and Neceſſity; and to be more freed from ſin, while thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt the Deſirableneſſe, and the way
<pb facs="tcp:119718:7"/> of that Freedome. Read, therefore, and conſider, and the Lord give his bleſſing. So prayes</p>

            <p>IT is generally and truly obſerved, That Civil warres are far worſe than with a Forraigne nation: for they are more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and more deſtructive; which party ſoever prevailes the Publique is a loſer, and ſuch victories leave ſmall cauſe for triumph. Sad experience in this nation tells us, that there have been more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate military ingagements in thoſe few yeares of our late warres, than have been in twice the time between other warring nations. And how deſtructive they have been both to perſons and eſtates, the ſenſible Countrey will pathetically tell any man, if he need information. Oh how many gallant Engliſh Champions ſlain! how many fair Buildings burnt pulled downe, and vaſt Eſtates ruined! And where is the man
<pb facs="tcp:119718:9"/> almoſt (if he had an eſtate before) that is not a great loſer? But there is another Civil Warre that is yet remaining, of more dangerous conſequence (although the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude are not as ſenſible of it, as of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) and that is the diſcord, that is even among brethren in spirituall matters, who yet agree in the fundamentals of the Faith. This Warre, as it hath the like violence, ſo is it more deſtructive in the Church, than that hath been in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. How many poore ſoules have been deſtroyed, and Churches ruined! and what Chriſtian almoſt (if he will but faithfully cast up his account) but hath been a great loſer by it in his ſpirituall eſtate! How ſad is it to ſee Proteſtants, not onely of the ſame Nation, but of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intimate and indeared acquaintance, write more bitterly one against another, than an ingenious Proteſtant would doe against a Papiſt! He that doth but read our modern Engliſh controverſies, will finde among many of them (I dare not ſay all) ſuch perſonall aſperſions and reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, criminations and recriminations, falſe charges, and foule miſ-interpreting of one anothers writings, that a third perſon, who expects to read ſomewhat of the Question controverted, findes ſo much written <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominem,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119718:9"/> that there is but little <hi>ad rem</hi> I am ſorry to ſee how much <hi>gall</hi> many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men put in their ink. A man would be alſo aſhamed to ſee, how ſome that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe other mens writings, do ſo farre wrest their words from their meanings; yea, go ſo far wide both of words and meanings, that it muſt be either through notorious wilfulneſſe, or ignorance, that they ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report them; if through wilfulneſſe, how great is their ſin! if through ignorance, how unfit are they to write Controverſies! How ſad is it, that ſome of good abilities, spend moſt of their time, they can well ſpare (and more too) from their neceſſary work of the Miniſtry, in ſtudying, and writing ſome <hi>ſmall</hi> Controverſie (in compariſon of many more weighty Truths) and thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their talents for many yeares, in the beſt of their age, in which time they might have done the Church of God good ſervice, by ſome more profitable Tractates. Had they bent that force against the Kingdome of Satan, and Antichriſt, which they have done againſt their Brethren, to the rending of the Church; their labour had been worth the owning, which now grieves them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee it ſo much ſlighted. Well may I ſay in this, what was ill spoken in another caſe, <hi>Quorſum perditio haec?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119718:10"/> Why is this wast? Waſt of time, wast of tae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to the waſting of each others reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yea to the waſting (I fear) of moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious grace in the Antagonists themſelves, &amp; which is worst of all, to the waſting of the Church. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome divided cannot ſtand.</hi> And, had not our late Wars (through Gods mercy) ſoon ended, we ſhould have ſeen (thoſe of us that had ſurvived) the ſaying ſadly fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our ſelves. But how dolefull a ſight is it to ſee the Viſible Kingdome of Chriſt himſelf, in this Nation, ſo miſerably divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and though the war of Field, and Garriſon, be ended; yet the war of Preſſe, and Pulpit, is as hot as ever. Alas! that in this ſenſe we ſo truly deſerve to be called the <hi>Church Militant!</hi> And I have little hopes to ſee it ended whilſt I live. And if it proceed as hotly, and deſtructively, as it hath done hitherto (which we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to feare) judge what Church-deſolation is like to be before this age be expired. This ſore evil is both our great ſin, and heavy judgement. And <hi>for thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>by this,</hi> justly may the Kingdome of God be taken from us, &amp; given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. O that God would both pardon, and remove this devouring evil, and create peace in the hearts, and Churches of
<pb facs="tcp:119718:10"/> his Saints! Then ſhould I hope to ſee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in a thriving condition; in the midſt of contention it muſt needs be languiſhing. <hi>For where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work,</hi> Jam. 3.16. And 'tis not without cauſe, that <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>holineſſe</hi> are linked together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
            <p>Reader, thou wilt find in this ſmall piece little of Controverſie; but ſomething of the <hi>myſterie of godlineſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> which (I hope) is <hi>without Controverſie</hi> with thee. The Antinomian and Libertine (which are ſcarcely two, but rather one) are the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Adverſaries that I oppoſe, which every Miniſter of the Gospel muſt do, that will preach practicall Divinity. Yea, which every man muſt really confute, that will be a ſerious Chriſtian: and if thou art ſuch a one thy ſelf (though but of ſmall gifts) it is probable thou haſt (beſides thy Bible) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers better Treatiſes than this, written by ſome ſuch men, as <hi>Preſton, Sibbs, Bolton, Ball, &amp;c.</hi> which I ſhall not deſire thee to lay aſide, for the reading of this. But if thou haſt ſpare time to reade variety, thou hadſt better read this, than many of the ſwarming Pamphlets, that flie abroad in theſe times. Thou wilt find cauſe enough (I am confident) to approve the ſubject, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (if thou art judicious) thou maiſt
<pb facs="tcp:119718:11"/> have reaſon to blame me for handling it no better. Here are (I hope) but few <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> things hard to be underſtood: for 'tis my uſuall courſe in preaching, to run (with <hi>Ahimaaz) the way of the plain;</hi> that ſo I may the ſooner bring good tidings to the ſoule. Such as it is, I leave it to thy candid peruſall at thy leiſure.

                  <hi>their ſins,</hi> and doubtleſſe from their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings too, but as their ſins onely are (expreſſely) mentioned, as that, from which they ſhould be ſaved; and this the reaſon, why Chriſt ſhould be named <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſo doubtleſſe this is that, that Chriſt primarily and chiefly intended <hi>to ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> even from ſin it ſelfe, at which I mainely aim in this Diſcourſe. Whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the great work of Chriſt our Saviour is the ſaving of his people from their ſins.</hi> Even from ſin it ſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:119718:21"/>
               <p>For our more cleer proceeding, I ſhall lay down theſe following poſitions;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Man is fallen from God, and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lyes under two great evills, 1. Sin. 2. Wrath for ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the work of Chriſt, to ſave his people from both theſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Salvation by Chriſt from the <hi>wrath of God due for ſin,</hi> is a mercy, ſo farre beyond our ability to deſerve, or requite, that if we had the tongue of men and Angels, we could never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently praiſe God, and Chriſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for this unſpeakable mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet the work of our Salvation from <hi>Sin it ſelfe</hi> is a greater mercy to us, and this is the Maſter-piece of what Chriſt our Saviour hath undertaken for us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By Salvation from ſin I doe not underſtand a bare removall of corrupt qualities, but a procuring, and beſtowing of good inſtead thereof: for we are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,</hi> as we are <hi>called, from uncleanneſs to holineſſe.</hi> And the privation of morall <hi>good</hi> in man is a ſin, as well as the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of morall <hi>evill,</hi> and in this latitude the Apoſtle defines ſin in that one word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 Job. 3.4. Which conſiſteth both in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative and Negative precepts, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119718:21"/> the not being, and doing, what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is a tranſgreſſion, as well, as being, and doing, what is forbidden.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine being thus ſtated, I proceed to the proof of it, 1. by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2. by Argument.</p>
               <p>There are divers Scriptures that ſpeak to our purpoſe, amongſt many take theſe few. Firſt, heare what Chriſts harbinger ſpeakes, yea, ſee how he points him out, Joh. 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſins of the World.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he was manifeſted to take away our ſins,</hi> 1. Joh. 3.5. <hi>And the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>that he loved and waſhed us from our ſins in his owne blood.</hi> Rev. 1.5. In all theſe texts we ſee, that <hi>ſin onely</hi> is expreſſed, and I believe that, which is <hi>ſpecially</hi> intended, although I know, that the guilt and fruit of ſin is alſo inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that Chriſt loved his Church and gave himſelfe for it, that he might ſanctifie, and cleanſe it,</hi> Eph. 5.25.26. thus likewiſe in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> c. 2. preſſing the duties of ſeverall ages, ſexes and orders of people to <hi>ver.</hi> 11 uſeth this with other weighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>that Chriſt gave himſelfe for us,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119718:22"/> that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto himſelfe, a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> ver. 14.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo <hi>Peter,</hi> exhorting the elect to be active in the wayes of holineſſe, not faſhioning themſelves to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer luſts, 1. <hi>Pet</hi> 1. from <hi>ver.</hi> 10. to <hi>v.</hi> 18. uſeth this, as a moſt forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (among others) <hi>ye know, that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver, and Gold, from your vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, received by tradition from your Fathers: but with the precious blood of Chriſt.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> The Firſt Argument is drawn from Gods honour, that is the chief work of Chriſt our Saviour, wherein God is moſt honoured; but God is moſt honoured in the ſaving his people from their ſins, therefore is this the chief work of Chriſt, &amp;c. That, that is the great, or chief work of Chriſt, wherein God is moſt glorified, will need little proof, for that muſt needs be the greateſt work, that moſt effectually atteineth the higheſt end: And what end higher, than the glory of God, which was the ſupreme end of all Chriſts undertakings? <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4.</p>

Thus God is much honoured by the great ſufferings of <hi>Job,</hi> while he ſinneth not. <hi>Job</hi> 1.20, 21. yea, God is ſo much honoured, that he makes his boaſt againſt Satan of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Job,</hi> cap. 2, 3. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, hast thou conſidered my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evill; and ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou movedſt me againſt him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him without cauſe?</hi> And on the contrary, how much is God diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our ſinfull eaſe, and proſperity; yea, moſt diſhonoured by it in thoſe that are redeemed from the guilt, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119718:23"/> puniſhment of ſinne. The groſſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of Gods people, give occaſion to the Enemies of God to <hi>blaspheme</hi> his name, and wayes. Thus when <hi>David</hi> had foulely offended, ſaith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Thou haſt given great occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. The crimes of Profeſſors are ever the moſt ſcandalous; yea, the ſins of Gods deareſt children, are moſt offenſive to God himſelfe, becauſe they are alſo committed againſt the greateſt mercy, and loving kindneſs. The Lord in this caſe is ready to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.12. <hi>It was not mine Enemy that reproached me, then I could have born it.</hi> But when a Sinner is ſaved from his ſins, God is much honoured both before An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> The ſecond Argument is drawn from the greatneſſe of the evill of <hi>ſin</hi> above ſuffering.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119718:26"/> both of the ſame eſſentiall, and integrall parts. But the difference is in growth: ſo the glorified in Heaven are the ſame, that were the ſanctified on Earth; onely in this they differ, what was begun here, is abſolutely perfect there: here they were regenerated,<note place="margin">John 3.3. 1 Pet. 2.2. Iſa. 66.11. Eph. 4.13.</note> and born againe, and as new-born babes fed upon the ſincere milke of the word, ſucking and being ſatisfied with the breaſts of conſolations: but there they are grown to a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, and ſit down at the marriage ſupper of the Lamb, continually feaſting themſelves in the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this argument may probably be the moſt taking with thoſe, that wait, and rejoyce in the hope of glory, I ſhall inſiſt the more largely upon it, and more particularly conſider, wherein Heavens glory conſiſteth. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, Rom. 14.17. <hi>The Kingdome of God is righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He ſpeaks indeed of the Kingdome of <hi>grace,</hi> but <hi>glory</hi> being the ſame <hi>in kinde,</hi> we may take a view of it, (as we are able) according to theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> which is the firſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119718:27"/> part of glory mentioned, hath different acceptions, and therefore we muſt give you a diſtinction by the way, 1. <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> is ſometimes taken in a <hi>ſtrict,</hi> and <hi>narrow ſence,</hi> and is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>holineſſe: holineſſe</hi> being a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the <hi>firſt</hi> table of the Law, and <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to the <hi>ſecond; holineſſe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſpect to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> to <hi>man</hi> (immediately) and in this ſenſe we take it in ſuch texts of Scripture, where holineſſe and righteouſneſſe are both expreſſed, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> is ſometimes taken more <hi>largely,</hi> and <hi>promiſcuouſly,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibly</hi> with holineſſe. And ſo where we read of righteouſneſſe, or holineſſe ſeverally in Scripture, one, and the ſame thing is uſually intended. And in this latitude, righteouſneſſe, or holineſſe is our conformity to the whole will of God, here <hi>ſincerely,</hi> hereafter <hi>perfectly.</hi> That <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> in this agree, I know will be eaſily granted; but how heavenly <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> ſhould depend upon perfect ſanctification (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it doth) may be more doubted. For the clearing of this (therefore) I ſhall ſpeak of theſe two later the more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Peace,</hi> which is the ſecond part of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119718:27"/> glory, is three-fold; 1. with God, 2. with our own Conſciences, 3. with Saints and Angels. 1. Peace with God is two-fold, 1. <hi>Procured,</hi> 2. <hi>Continued.</hi> 1. Peace with God <hi>procured</hi> is (I confeſſe) from a work wrought without us, to wit, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt on our behalfe according to what the Law required, and depends upon Gods gracious acceptation of us in Chriſt, yet is holineſſe a neceſſary condition, or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the perſon, that ſhall enter into peace, as the Prophet phraſeth it, Iſa. 57.2. <hi>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come, he ſhall enter into peace;</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Peace with God <hi>continued</hi> depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a work of Chriſt within us, to wit, the work of Sanctification: for (being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Sanctified) in Heaven, we do the will of God perfectly, and diſpleaſe him no more; ſo that the peace formerly made is no more broken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Peace of Conſcience muſt needs be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, when a man comes to be perfectly holy, and to enjoy perfect peace with God: yea, it were a contradiction to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe For to have Conſcience, accuſing for doing well, were a ſinfull error of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and contrary to perfect holineſſe. Conſcience is a Judge, and to clear the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and condemn the innocent, is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119718:28"/> to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. and how can holineſſe be perfect, unleſſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be perfect alſo. Doth not Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence belong to the practicall underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? and if this be perfected, is not the perfection of Conſcience included in it? Or if you will make Conſcience to be a diſtinct faculty of the Soul, it matters not (in this caſe) ſo that we make it any thing belonging to the Soul; for if the Soul in Heaven be perfectly good; every power and faculty of it muſt be perfectly ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; amongſt which, <hi>Conſcience</hi> will finde a place <note n="m" place="margin">Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia humana est judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis de ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metipſo, prout ſubjici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio Dei. <hi>Ameſ. de Conſ. p. 1.</hi>
                  </note>. <hi>Conſcience</hi> (as Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> defines it) <hi>is Mans judgement concerning himſelfe, as it is ſubject to the judgement of God.</hi> Therefore when God ſpeaks peace, perfected Conſcience (as it is in Heaven) muſt needs ſpeak ſo too; and that Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot be <hi>perfectly good,</hi> which is not <hi>quietly good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some diſtinguiſh of foure ſorts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Conſcience good, but not quiet. Such is the Conſcience of a child of Light walking in Darkneſſe. Such was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſometime of <hi>David,</hi> and other of Gods Children.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Conſcience quiet, but not good. Such a Conſcience, as cryes peace, peace, to the ſinner, while he goes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119718:28"/> on in the ſtubborneſſe of his own heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Conſcience quiet, and good. Such is the Conſcience of a Child of God, when he walkes in Gods wayes, and in the light of his Countenance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Conſcience neither good nor quiet. Such is the accuſing, gnawing Conſcience of a wicked Man: ſuch was the Conſcience of <hi>Iudas,</hi> after he had betrayed Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But after this life, the two firſt of theſe will be taken away:</p>
               <p n="1">1. For when a man is perfectly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified (as he ſhall be in Heaven) there will be no room for Conſcience to be unquiet, becauſe it will have no matter, for which to accuſe, but will be <hi>perfectly quiet,</hi> as the ſtate of the Soule is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Conſcience of the damned in Hell, as it is <hi>perfectly evill,</hi> ſo it is as reſtleſſe and unquiet: the worm as it never dyeth, ſo it alwayes worketh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Perfect peace with Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is but the perfection of the grace of love mutually exerciſed.</p>
               <p>The third part of Heavens happineſſe is perfect joy: now joy is an affection of the Soule, and the Soule being perfectly ſanctified in glory, this affection muſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119718:29"/> be perfected, as well as Love, and the reſt of the Affections; which muſt all be taken in to make up the perfect ſanctification of the Soule. Perfect joy requires two things to its <hi>morall,</hi> as well, as its <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That it be fixed upon God the chiefeſt good, which is the onely ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory object. And our joy here is therefore ſinfully <hi>imperfect,</hi> becauſe we fixe it upon creature-comforts, which are not <hi>perfect:</hi> But God, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, is to be the onely object of our joy, and other things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in, onely in ſubordination to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perfect joy requires a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in this perfect object, and in this life the joy of the Saints, is therefore imperfect, becauſe (though it be fixed upon God, yet) it is but imperfectly exerciſed. Thus in both theſe reſpects our joy here is <hi>ſinfully,</hi> as well as <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> defective. But in Heaven we ſhall perfectly rejoyce in God, our perfect good; and I hope none will deny, but it is our duty to rejoyce in God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, with the moſt intenſe degree of joy, and it were our ſinne to doe any leſſe. What is this part of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119718:29"/> (then) but a moſt neceſſary part of our perfect holineſſe? And in all theſe we ſee, that <hi>perfect Holineſſe is Heavens happineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another argument proving the great work of Chriſt our Saviour to be the ſaving of his people from their ſins, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>4</label> may be drawn from the main ſcope and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Scripture. That muſt needs be the great work of Chriſt our Saviour, which Scripture (that is the word of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) chiefly points out unto us. But it is our ſalvation from ſin, or ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Scripture chiefly points out unto us.<note place="margin">Eph. 1.13. Col. 3.16.</note> Therefore this is the great work of Chriſt, &amp;c. The Goſpel is called the Goſpel of our ſalvation, becauſe it ſhews us the way of ſalvation. And it is called <hi>the Word of Chriſt,</hi> not onely becauſe it was endited by the Spirit of Chriſt; but alſo becauſe Chriſt is the ſubject, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Scripture chiefly treats. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternall life, and they are they that teſtifie of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Chriſt is the ſubject of <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, and of all the Propheſies of the holy Prophets, and the New Teſtament is called the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or joyfull meſſage of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe therein is brought unto
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119718:30"/> us news of our <hi>ſalvation by Chriſt;</hi> yea the will of Chriſt revealed in his Word, being the inſtrument, or means of our ſalvation muſt needs concur with Chriſt the principall Efficient of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now Scripture mainly inſiſts upon the doctrine of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which is our <hi>ſalvation from ſin,</hi> which will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if we take a generall view of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thus:

               <p>Secondly, the threats are to deter us from diſobedience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Promiſes (moſt of them) are of the rewards of grace <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Gracious rewards; or rewards, not <hi>for</hi> grace <hi>in us,</hi> but <hi>from</hi> grace <hi>in God.</hi>
                  </note>, for our encouragement to all holy obedience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Examples are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of wicked men in the wayes of wickedneſſe, and the judgement of God upon them for it, that we may beware of partaking in their ſins, leſt we be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo partakers of their plagues.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:119718:30"/>2. Examples of godly men in the wayes of holineſſe, and of the bleſſing of God upon them in their wayes, that we may be excited to tread in their ſteps. And thus we ſee, that the Scripture, which is the Word of life, and ſalvation by Chriſt, is the doctrine of holineſſe, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us all along in the wayes of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Yea, Chriſts owne Sermons (if we doe but obſerve them) are moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>But doth not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <label type="milestone">

The Son created, <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2.

Where note by the way, that in this work, though the three perſons are

As the Soule gives life to the Body, and the Body lives no longer than the Soule is united to it; but becomes a dead carcaſe, whenſoever it is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it: So if Chriſt, (who is the life of the Soule) ſhould be ſevered from it, it would immediately become dead againe in Treſpaſſes, and Sinnes, and able to doe no more in Grace, than a dead Corps in Nature. This our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt himſelf excellently proves, and illuſtrates in another compariſon, John 15.5, 6. <hi>As the branch cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me: I am the vine, and ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can doe nothing.</hi> As the branches, that ſprout out of the vine, receive ſap from it, whereby they are preſerved, and become fruitfull, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once broken off, become dead and fruitleſſe, having no more ſap or life in themſelves.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some ſay this is done for the greater exaltation of Gods free Grace, to make us the more ſenſible of what he hath done for us; that we may have no cauſe of glorying in our ſelves, but may give all the glory unto God. But this Anſwer ſeemes to me to be of no great force. For had we bin Sanctified wholly at once, the work would have been no leſſe of grace, then now it is, there would have bin nothing of our merit in it. If a Phyſitian ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake freely, and upon his own care, and charge to heal a poor ſick perſon, who is not able to give him a Fee, is it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119718:42"/> not as free (if he thought it fit) to cure him perfectly in a day, as if he take ſeaven yeares to perfect the cure? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould we have bin leſſe ſenſible of what the Lord had done, or have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the more in our ſelves, or the leſs in God. Yea, had we bin perfectly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified all at once, ſhould we not have bin the more ſenſible of ſo weighty, and ſuddaine a change; and have gloried leſs in our ſelves, and more in God in that ſtate of perfect Sanctification, then now we are able to doe in a ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection? We ſet up our own, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the due praiſes of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, till we come to a ſtate of perfect holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither dare I adventure to ſay with ſome, that this is done to keep us humble, and low in our owne eyes. 'Tis true (I know) that our daily imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are matters of humiliation, and the conſideration of them ſhould make us the more humble: But were we perfectly ſanctified, we ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly humble, and there would be no room for pride.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I apprehend any great weight, in what other particular reaſons I have ſeen given for it: For I doe not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119718:42"/> remember any ſpeciall reaſon given in Scripture, It is ſufficient that God hath revealed it his will to have it ſo, and we are abundantly bound to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for our deliverance, whether it be ſooner or later compleated. We loſt our ſtock of grace ſodainly, and are long in recovering our loſſe. We were wounded in a moment, but are not ſo ſoon healed: Our Chirurgion was able to have wrought the cure in as little time, as we made the wound. But let us waite the Lords leiſure, for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our Souls in his own order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out too curiouſly prying into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his method.</p>

               <p>Obj. <hi>But is not the outward teaching to be layd aſide? Is it not ſaid,</hi> Jer. 31.33, 34. This is the Covenant, that I will make with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward paths,—And they ſhall teach no more—<hi>And doth not the Author to the</hi> Hebrewes <hi>interpret it of the dayes of the Gospel, and ſay, expreſſely,</hi> they ſhall not teach, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>Muſt we not then wait only for the inward, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teaching of the Spirit of God?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Lord intended not the laying aſide of outward teaching; for Chriſt himſelfe went up and downe preaching the Goſpel before his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119718:50"/> he taught his Diſciples alſo after his reſurrection, as appears <hi>Ma.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.14. <hi>ad</hi> 19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.36, to 51. He gave a new Commiſſion to his Diſciples, to goe teach all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. and promiſeth to be with them, and with thoſe, that ſhould ſucceed them in the work of the Miniſtery to the end of the world. And he, who is the chiefe Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, committed the feeding of his flock to them. <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. The fruit of his Aſcention was the giving of <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and Teachers for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry:</hi> And we muſt not be ſo abſurd, as to thinke that Chriſt by his owne practiſe, and commſſion to others contradicted the Propheſies; <hi>I came not to deſtroy the Law, or the Prophets, but to fulfill,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. The teaching of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is a ſelf confutation to the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: for if no man muſt teach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then they that are of this opinion muſt not teach it others, but muſt leave God to teach them that, as well as other things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. But to inquire more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ſenſe, and meaning of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119718:51"/> place, we muſt note, that the Author of this Epiſtle, comparing <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> together, preferres Chriſt in all things above him, and comparing the internall efficacy of Chriſt, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal adminiſtrations of the Law, ſhews, that Chriſt was the ſubſtance of thoſe ſhadowes in the Ceremoniall Law, and that from Chriſt onely was Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to obey ſincerely the Moral Law, according to thoſe words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Of his fulneſſe have all we received, and Grace for Grace. For the Law was given by Moſes, but Grace &amp; Truth came by Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> Which being well underſtood would be a good Commentary upon a great part of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews. The great error of the Jews, was their reſting in themſelves, and the Letter of the Law. They had the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> and reſting in thoſe types, and ſhadows, looked not with an eye of Faith to Chriſt the <hi>Antitipe,</hi> who was the end and ſcope of the Law, and alone able to take away ſinne, as pertaining to the Conſcience. They had alſo the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> written in tables of ſtone, and reſted in their own ſtrength, according to the Letter of the Law and thought to expiate their defects, by thoſe carnall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119718:51"/> offerings, as <hi>Paul</hi> plainly and largely declares, if we compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32, 33. with the former part of the tenth Chapter. Now in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, the Apoſtle clearly ſhews, that Chriſt was the ſubſtance of thoſe things, whereof the Ceremonies were ſhadows: and that as <hi>Moſes</hi> taught outwardly onely, ſo Chriſt alone teacheth inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, powerfully, and effectually; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Lawes in the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So that all (as I conceive) that can be truly gathered out of theſe words, is, that the inward, effectuall teaching, or writing of the Law upon the heart, is the proper, and peculiar work of Chriſt; and he was therefore to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred farre above <hi>Moſes,</hi> (ſo highly magnified by the Jewes) who being but a Miniſter, could onely teach out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> IF the great work of Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour be the <hi>ſaving of his people from their ſins,</hi> then this may informe us, how to anſwer an argument of the Papiſts againſt two points of Doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we, with the Reformed Churches dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them. The firſt is the Doctrine of <hi>Iuſtification.</hi> The ſecond is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>aſſurance of Salvation.</hi> In the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> (ſay they) that, which maketh us righteous before God, and cauſeth us to be accepted to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, is remiſſion of ſinnes, and the habits of inward righteouſneſſe, or Charity with the fruits thereof.</p>
               <p>We deny the habits of righteouſneſſe, or Sanctification to be the thing, by which, <hi>in whole,</hi> or <hi>in part,</hi> we are to be juſtified in the ſight of God, either as ſatisfactory to Juſtice, or Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of Reward, and affirme, that <hi>we are juſtified by Faith in Chriſt alone, without the deeds of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:119718:52"/>
               <p>They object among many, other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that our way of Juſtification by Faith alone, is the way to <hi>baniſh good workes</hi> out of the world, and to open a gate for <hi>carnall liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which our Divines uſually anſwer, that <hi>we are juſtified by Faith alone,</hi> but not by <hi>ſuch a Faith as is alone:</hi> that it is ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>worketh by love,</hi> and brings forth the <hi>fruits of righteouſneſſe.</hi> And although we do not <hi>doe good works</hi> to be <hi>juſtified by them,</hi> as any part of our <hi>legall righteouſneſſe,</hi> yet the <hi>practice of good workes</hi> we hold moſt neceſſary, for many other good reaſons. But not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to give any account of thoſe many reaſons we aſſigne, let us conſider what anſwer this Doctrine in hand will afford. Saving Faith is to accept of, and embrace Chriſt for <hi>Salvation,</hi> to wit, that we may have that <hi>Salvation</hi> applyed to us, which he hath <hi>purchaſed for us,</hi> and what that is, hath been already ſhewed, to wit, <hi>Salvation from ſinne,</hi> and not meerely from <hi>wrath for ſinne.</hi> This is Salvation both in Scripture-ſenſe, and language, as you have heard at large. Chriſt did not purchaſe our Salvation piece-meale, neither doth he beſtow it piece-meale, neither can we receive it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119718:53"/> piece-meale, he will be a <hi>whole Saviour,</hi> or <hi>no Saviour.</hi> He that believes that he may be ſaved, believes that he may be ſaved from the <hi>whole miſery</hi> of his Soul; which is both <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>wrath:</hi> and he that doth not <hi>thus believe,</hi> doth not <hi>ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly believe,</hi> and he that doth thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, or embrace him, leaves no room for carnall liberty.</p>
               <p>If we phanſie to our ſelves ſuch a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as Scripture ſpeakes not of, and then draw abſurdities from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Salvation by Faith alone, the abſurdity will returne upon the miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Objectors. If a Man ſhould ſay, he believes in Chriſt, to be ſaved from <hi>ſinne,</hi> and not from <hi>wrath,</hi> our Adverſaries (I ſuppoſe) would not call that ſaving Faith, and we have leſſe cauſe to call that ſaving Faith, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to believe in Chriſt to be ſaved from <hi>wrath,</hi> and not from <hi>ſinne,</hi> (as appeares by the arguments confirming the Doctrine) Chriſt, as our <hi>whole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> to wit, from <hi>both</hi> thoſe evils, is the <hi>adaequate object</hi> of ſaving Faith, which is therefore both Juſtifying, and Sanctifying Faith, and not a Carnall, or Licentious Faith, or rather phantaſie as they make it.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:119718:53"/>
               <p>Were there no evill, that we ſhould be ſaved from by believing, but onely that of ſuffering the wrath of God for ſinne, their argument might ſeem to have the greater ſtrength, although it would then be found too weak. But when the Soule looks upon <hi>ſin it ſelfe,</hi> as the <hi>great</hi> enemy, from which Chriſt came to ſave his people; and flies to Chriſt, that it may obtaine deliverance, how can it at the ſame time give wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come entertainment to ſinne? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Man to have fellowſhip and communion with pleaſure, and delight, and without feare, with a man, that he is flying from, as his moſt mortall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, haſting to a place of refuge to be ſecured from him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. They object likewiſe againſt the Doctrine of aſſurance of Salvation. We affirming, that there may be a certainty, and infallibility by Faith <note n="l" place="margin">Faith, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of ſpeciall Grace, wrought in the heart, gives us aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Salvation.</note>: they aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we can only have a probability by hope; arguing, that the Doctrine of certainty of Salvation tends to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſecurity, to which we may likewiſe anſwer out of this Doctrine: That if Chriſt came to ſave his people from their <hi>ſinnes,</hi> it would be a contradiction to aſſert, that a Man may be aſſured of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119718:54"/> his Salvation at the ſame time, while he allowes himſelf in carnall ſecurity, which is reall bondage. He that deliberately allowes himſelfe in a courſe of carnall liberty, may thereby aſſure himſelfe, that he is <hi>not</hi> in a ſtate of Salvation, for 'tis evident, that he lies under the <hi>great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that Chriſt came to ſave his people from:</hi> and it may be truly ſaid to ſuch a Man, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Simon Magus, Thou haſt neither part, nor lot in this Matter</hi> [of Salvation] <hi>for thy heart is not right in the ſight of God—thou art in the gall of bitterneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 8.21.</note> 
                  <hi>and bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this objection of theirs, there would be likewiſe the more appearance of ſtrength, although not ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to their purpoſe, did Salvation conſiſt onely in being juſtified, and ſo delivered from Gods avenging wrath. But if the Maſter-piece of our Salvation be to be ſaved from <hi>ſin it ſelfe,</hi> as hath been proved, how can it be ſuppoſed, that aſſurance of Salvation ſhould give liberty to ſin?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. Hence it is no wonder, that a child of God after falling into groſſe ſinnes. or more then ordinary remiſſeneſſe in the ſervice of God, ſhould upon the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119718:54"/> triall of his Eſtate, want aſſurance of Salvation. If <hi>Chriſt came to ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> can his people be aſſured of Salvation, while they goe on careleſly in ſinning? It is true, a miſguided, or ſleepy conſcience may forbeare to moleſt, or trouble a man, that hath let looſe the reines to carnall liberty: but a cleer, awakened conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will not ſpeak peace in ſuch a caſe as this. When <hi>David</hi> had fallen into thoſe foule ſinnes of Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, no ſooner was his Conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, but he was at a loſſe for the comfortable aſſurance of his Salvation: his inward joy and peace, were drowned in his Luſts, which cauſed him ſadly to bewaile his ſinne, and pray earneſtly, <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation, Pſal.</hi> 51.12. Were we but as ſenſible of ſpirituall, as we are of bodily injury; our ſinnes we fall into, would be unto our Soules, as ſo many wounds, and bruiſes are to our bodies, cauſing pain and griefe: But the remainder of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the beſt of Gods Servants, doth much dull their ſpirituall ſenſes, whereby they are not ſo clearly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed to diſcerne between good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: yet the faithfull Servants of God
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119718:55"/> have ſo much ſpirituall ſenſe of the evill of ſinne (at leaſtwiſe after ſome time of recollection) that they feel their foule miſcarriages paining them to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. They are unto them like ſo many putrified wounds, broken bones, or bones out of joynt, as <hi>David</hi> complains, Pſal. 38.3, 5. <hi>There is no ſoundneſſe in my fleſh, becauſe of thine anger, neither is there any reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſinne. My wounds ſtink and are corrupt, becauſe of my fooliſhneſſe. Bleſſed are the pure in heart,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. to wit, <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably here,</hi> as well as <hi>joyfully hereafter:</hi> if purity qualifies the Soule, ſo as that it may the more cleerly ſee God, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of Heart, and Life, muſt be as a thick cloud interpoſing betwixt the Soule, and the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſo that it cannot be refreſhed with the beames of his favour, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, till by ſerious repentance the cloud be removed.</p>

This will likewiſe informe us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may in the avoiding of evill, and doing of good, propoſe the eſcaping of Hell, and obtaining ſalvation, as the end of ſo doing. Our ſins diſhonour God, by our ſanctification we glorifie
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119718:55"/> him: and he commands us to read, hear, pray, &amp;c. for the ſubduing of ſin, and increaſe of grace; and muſt we not preſſe on ſtill forwards, towards perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, continually growing in grace, till we come to glory, which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of grace? This is our <hi>ſalvation</hi> to be ſaved from <hi>ſinne,</hi> and towards this all the means of grace, and duties of piety tend: the Word, that we hear, is the ſword of the Spirit, for the ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>ſinne,</hi> we pray againſt <hi>ſinne,</hi> watch againſt <hi>ſinne,</hi> ſtrive againſt <hi>ſinne,</hi> and may we not doe it to be ſaved from <hi>ſinne?</hi> nay, can we rightly or ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally uſe the meanes, without minding this end? Doth not Heavens happineſſe conſiſt in the enjoyment of God in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and is not God moſt glorified by us, when his glorious Image is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in us?

               <p>May we not make the eſcaping of Hell alſo the end of our duties, (if we doe but in any meaſure underſtand what Hell is) without being Legalliſts?

               <p>Grace lies not meerely in the <hi>head,</hi> but chiefly in the <hi>heart,</hi> and in the <hi>feet</hi> alſo of a Chriſtian, to wit, the <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> in the <hi>inward affection,</hi> and the <hi>exerciſe</hi> in the <hi>outward converſation,</hi> or courſe of life, together with the actings of the <hi>inward faculties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>heart,</hi> or inward affections.

                  <hi>heart</hi> inditeth <hi>matter</hi> for prayer, and praiſe, <hi>My heart is inditing a good matter,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 45.1. The <hi>head</hi> may dictate to the <hi>tongue,</hi> but <hi>grace</hi> frameth and fixeth the <hi>heart</hi> for duty. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7. <hi>My heart is fixed, O God my heart is fixed.</hi> Here the <hi>heart</hi> leadeth the way to the outward ſervice, calling upon, &amp; awakening the tongue, Pſaltery and Harp, ver. 8. <hi>Awake my glory,</hi> that is my tongue, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called our <hi>glory,</hi> becauſe it is the inſtrument wherewith man glorifies God: compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.26. and you ſhall finde, that that which the Pſalmiſt calleth the <hi>glory,</hi> the Apoſtle tranſlateth the <hi>tongue</hi> in quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that text, <hi>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. True Grace is alſo much in the <hi>feet</hi> of a Chriſtian, I mean the exerciſe of grace is in the courſe of life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation (not excluding the inward exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe) which is called our <hi>way,</hi> wherein we are to <hi>walk</hi> according to the Word of God.

Pſal. 119.59. <hi>I thought on my

Thus ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.1. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord;</hi> yea, Grace cauſeth not onely to <hi>walk,</hi> but alſo to <hi>run</hi> in the waies of God: Thus likewiſe ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.32. <hi>I will run the way of thy commandements.</hi> Thus Paul, <hi>I therefore ſo run, not as uncertainly,</hi> 1 Cor 9.26. and he exhorteth us, v. 24. <hi>So run, that ye may obtain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gifts</hi> have been, and are ſtill much abuſed, but <hi>Grace</hi> cannot be miſimplied. The ſtrivings, hot contendings, fearfull ſchiſmes and factions in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> were made through the pride and vainglory of the <hi>gifted men</hi> among them. There were ſo many <hi>tongues</hi> and ſo many <hi>speakers,</hi> puffed up with ſelf-conceit, that thoſe <hi>gifts,</hi> which were given them for <hi>edification,</hi> were abuſed to <hi>oſtentation,</hi> and <hi>confuſion</hi> in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meetings: which <hi>Paul</hi> corrects, as we read at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:119718:68"/>
               <p>What is the cauſe of our ſad diviſions, and the great diſorder that we are grown into, but this, that men play the wantons with the <hi>gifts</hi> that God hath given them?

               <p>Let then the moſt humble, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſelfe-denying, ſerious Chriſtian, be accounted the beſt, and let <hi>grace</hi> be ever preferred before <hi>gifts.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Laſtly, if Chriſts great work be the <hi>ſaving of his people from their ſins,</hi> this informes us, that a ſoule given up to a ſtate of ſin, is in a moſt ſad condition. No judgement like that of being given up to a reprobate ſenſe, and vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Had we ſtood with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſeen <hi>Sodom</hi> flaming, and ſmoking with fire and brimſtone, and ſo terrible wrath from Heaven conſuming her inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, would not our hearts have aked within us, at ſo dreadfull a ſight? But that which righteous <hi>Lot</hi> ſaw, while he lived among them, which vexed his ſoul from day to day, even their filthy and unlawfull deeds, was, in itſelf a ſight far
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119718:69"/> more grievous to behold. Men are apt to judge, that God is highly diſpleaſed with thoſe that fall under ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, temporall judgement, but little regard his wrath, in giving up ſoules to <hi>ſinne;</hi> yea, a ſeeming judgement ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times begets an haſty and raſh cenſure: When the Viper faſtned upon <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, <hi>no doubt,</hi> ſaid the Barbarians <hi>this man is a murtherer, whom, though he hath eſcaped the Sea, yet vengeance ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not to live,</hi> Acts 28.4. And had <hi>Job</hi> lived in our daies, we ſhould have had many ready to charge him in the depth of his miſery with wickedneſs, and hypocriſie, as his friends did. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, there is a ſort of vengeance from heaven, that lies upon the greateſt part of the world, and upon many among us, which is little regarded, and that is, <hi>Gods leaving men up to their own hearts luſts.</hi> Rom. 1.24, 26. <hi>Wherefore God alſo gave them up to uncleanneſſe, through the luſts of their own hearts, to diſhonour their bodies betweene themſelves;</hi> and ver. 26. <hi>For this cauſe God gave them up to vile affections.</hi> To the like purpoſe ſpeaketh <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 22.14. <hi>The mouth of ſtrange women is a deep pit, he that is abhorred of the Lord ſhall fall
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119718:69"/> therein.</hi> And 'tis well reckoned by the Pſalmiſt, among the heavy judgements upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, that when they luſted exceedingly, &amp; tempted God, <hi>he gave them their requeſt, but ſent lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into their ſouls,</hi> Pſ. 106.14, 16. Pſ. 81.11, 12. <hi>But my people would not hearken unto my voice, &amp; I rael would none of me; ſo I gave them up unto their owne hearts luſts, &amp; they walked in their own counſels:</hi> &amp; the judgement upon evil men &amp; ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is, that they <hi>ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13. And were it well conſidered, we might obſerve the remarkable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon many in theſe times. How many of thoſe that waxed wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and deſpiſed the precious Truths and Ordinances of God, are now given up to ſwearing, drunkenneſſe, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſuch like abominable wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe! Had theſe men been ſmitten with lightning, and thunderbolts from heaven, for their departure from the waies of righteouſneſſe, we ſhould have been ready to ſay, <hi>this is the finger of God.</hi> Certainely God hath already pointed them out more ſadly by the heavieſt plagues, in that they have been given up to helliſh blaſphemies, and to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119718:70"/> work wickedneſſe with greedineſſe; and his hand in this is more heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, than if we had ſeen them fall dead in our ſtreets. As it is the <hi>Saints</hi> happineſſe that their little grace ſhall be <hi>improved;</hi> ſo is it the miſery of a multitude of ſeared <hi>Sinners,</hi> that their filthy and vile affections ſhall be ſtill <hi>increaſed,</hi> as it is written, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill, and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill; and he that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, let him be righteous ſtill, and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill.</hi>

               <p>Some <hi>errors</hi> there are, that more evidently tend to hinder this work of Chriſt, I ſhall inſtance in one or two of them. Firſt, that Pelagian Hereſie, that denies the propagation of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne. They ſay [we derive ſinne from our parents onely by imitation.] How ſhall that enemy be deſtroyed, that is concealed and denied? How ſhall a man labour to mortifie this body of ſin, when he denies that we beare any ſuch body about us? Surely <hi>Rahabs</hi> hiding the Spies, was not more effectual to their preſervation, and the ruine of the city <hi>Jericho,</hi> than this Pelagian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is to the ſaving of ſin, and the utter ruin of the ſoul. <hi>Whoſo covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Antinomians teach, that no man ought to doubt of <hi>Gods</hi> love, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly believe that his ſins were eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119718:74"/> pardoned, and himſelf juſtified, and that whatever he doth, he need not be in care or doubt: God ſees his ſin no more, the Lord takes no notice of the ſins of his ſervants, ſay they, abuſing that Scripture to that end; <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21. <hi>He hath not beheld ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither hath he ſeen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe in</hi> Iſrael. And <hi>repentance</hi> they affirm to be the voice of the <hi>Law,</hi> not of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this the very way of the carnal multitude, to ſin without godly ſorrow, and yet perſwade themſelves of an intereſt in Gods ſaving mercy? What is this but to turn Faith into a meere phantaſie? And whither doth this tend, but to make ſinners ſecure in the midſt of the greateſt miſery? O how many ſoules are this day poyſoned in <hi>England</hi> with this damnable doctrine! and how ſad will the account be of thoſe that have ſo groſly deluded them! to deny the doctrine of <hi>repentance</hi> to be <hi>Goſpel-doctrine,</hi> is no leſſe dangerous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to ſoules, than that Popiſh doctrine, that denies Juſtification by Faith in the alone merits of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I will not now ſtand to confute this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119718:74"/> preſumptuous doctrine, it being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in a uſe of reproof, and it hath been well done already by other <note n="n" place="margin">By Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Anth: Burgeſs</hi> &amp; others.</note> hands.

               <p>Firſt, this ſuppoſeth, that thoſe, who ordinarily preach Errors, have ſome ſpeciall truth to reveale, that others are ignorant of. But that is ſtrange, that a truth of God ſhould be hid from all godly, able, and Orthodox Miniſters of the Goſpel, and revealed to ſuch as ordinarily maintain a multitude of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. When the Apoſtle (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1.) bids <hi>Try the spirits, whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world;</hi> he intimates,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119718:75"/> that <hi>ſeducing ſpirits</hi> are <hi>not</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; that thoſe that preach groſs <hi>Errors</hi> are of the <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> that are gone forth. Now that God ſhould reveale his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſecrets to ſuch as theſe, and hide them from his ſervants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, is a ſecret indeed, ſuch (I believe) as was never heard of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If this poſition be true, the Jeſuite may come in and plead for a childs part in this toleration: for he will preach ſome truths with leſſe than a hundred errors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is a very ſtrange way to preſerve one Truth from being loſt, for if a hundred Errors be preached with one Truth, it is moſt like that the hearers receive many of the Errors, and loſe the Truth, that can ſcarcely be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned in ſo great a crowd of falſhood, eſpecially conſidering how ignorant the multitude is, and how prone we are by nature to erre. And a ſtranger way this is to nouriſh ſouls: <hi>Truth</hi> is as <hi>wholſome food,</hi> &amp; <hi>Error</hi> of a <hi>poyſoning na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and if you cut, and ſet before a child a <hi>hundred</hi> bits of <hi>poyſon,</hi> and but <hi>one</hi> bit of <hi>wholſome food,</hi> and bid him eat, tis a <hi>hundred to one</hi> but he <hi>poyſons</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When a Preacher preacheth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119718:75"/> Truth and Error mixed together, he preſſeth all upon the hearers for truth. Suppoſe then a <hi>hundred Errors</hi> and <hi>one Truth</hi> ſhould be received by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they loſe a <hi>hundred</hi> truths for the gaining of <hi>one;</hi> for in every <hi>error recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> there is a <hi>truth loſt</hi> to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the error, becauſe every <hi>error</hi> is contradictory to ſome <hi>truth.</hi> Verily he that ſhould loſe five pounds to gain a ſhilling, would at laſt be forced to cry, <hi>Fie on the winning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, A hundred errors, ſuch as are in our daies, were enough to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel, or rather to pervert the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and then tell me what meanes that ſaying, <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.8. <hi>There be ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt; But though we, or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi> Conſider alſo that ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſions, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might inſtance in divers other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tenents tending to root out the power of godlineſſe, and that which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119718:76"/> makes the temptation the more ſtrong and dangerous, is, that all manner of <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>rotten tenents,</hi> go under the name of <hi>higher attainments:</hi> True <hi>piety</hi> is accounted but <hi>old formality,</hi> and the moſt <hi>wanton Opinioniſts</hi> are reputed for <hi>precious Saints.</hi> But when <hi>Sathan</hi> transformes himſelf into an <hi>Angel of light,</hi> and his <hi>Miniſters</hi> into <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> no marvail if a vizour of holineſſe be put upon many ſtrange fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, even Familiſts, and Ranters will be re-baptized by the name of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Arius, Pelagius, Socinus,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be canonized. Doubtleſſe, his Holineſſe, the Pope, hath much hopes of a great harveſt amongſt us, for by this time he may be perſwaded, that many of thoſe that were ſo hot againſt a few Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, calling them the <hi>rags</hi> and <hi>remnants</hi> of Popery, were offended with the <hi>rags,</hi> becauſe they were but <hi>rags,</hi> and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the <hi>remnants</hi> of Popery, becauſe they had a minde to receive it by the <hi>whole piece.</hi> What are the Doctrines of <hi>Arminius,</hi> but pieces of Popery a little more finely dreſſed, that they may be the more handſomely worne? or a Popiſh diſh more finely cooked to pleaſe the palate, and ſo go the more
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119718:76"/> eaſily down. 'Tis not long ſince this aſſertion [that God did chooſe his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect for ſome excellency that he foreſaw to be in them] was preſented to ſome of you, at a private meeting, in a Lordly diſh. <note n="o" place="margin">By an Officer of the Army, who quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in town.</note> Surely Papiſts are glad to ſee us reliſh ſo many of their dainties, and hope we will make no bones of the reſt; for after we have thus <hi>feaſted</hi> with them a while, they may expect us willing to <hi>faſt</hi> with them too, ſeeing <hi>Ignorance is become the mother of our Devotion.</hi> But through the mercy of God, though many have ſurfeited, yet it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an epidemicall diſeaſe. Yea, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his name, he hath reſerved to himſelf, for the good of his Church, a conſiderable party of faithful Miniſters, whom he hath furniſhed with ability, and courage earneſtly to contend for that faith that was once delivered to them, that were Saints indeed. Yea, <hi>England</hi> is at this day furniſhed with a greater number of godly, able and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters of the Goſpel, than any of the generations of our Anceſtors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, or than is found in any other nation throughout the world.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of thoſe, that hinder the ſalvation of others, are ſuch as are
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119718:77"/> enemies to the Churches Reformation. No doubt but the keyes of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> are both Chriſts ordinary meanes for the <hi>ſaving</hi> of <hi>ſoules,</hi> yea, the ſevere cenſure of <hi>excommunication,</hi> called <hi>a delivering up to Sathan,</hi> is but for the <hi>deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. And the ſharpneſſe of Diſcipline, as <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe tells us is a <hi>power that the Lord hath given us to edification, and not to destruction.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.10. And if ſo, then the reſiſting of this work of Chriſt, tends to the <hi>ſaving</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>deſtroying</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> directly to <hi>deſtruction</hi> and not to <hi>edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Bitter Pills, and purging Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are for the health of the body, though harſh to the taſte; and as thoſe that hinder the ſick from the means of recovery, are plainly acceſſary to their death, ſo is it in the caſe of our preſent Church-diſtempers. How doe ſome plead the diſadvantage of theſe times, as thoſe that cried out <hi>The time is not come that the Lords houſe ſhould be built.</hi> Hag. 1.2. others are ready to ſcorne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the work, as <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobias,</hi> becauſe of the weakneſſe and paucity of the builders. But if the work be the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119718:77"/> Lords (as I doubt not but it is) he will ſurely declare, that his <hi>ſtrength</hi> is made perfect in <hi>weakneſſe.</hi> Others, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their wilfull exorbitances, are bent to reject the yoke of Chriſt, as too heavy for them (though eaſie in it ſelf) and to ſay in their hearts, <hi>Who is Lord over us?</hi> Oh that ſuch would ſeriouſly conſider that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>But thoſe mine enemies, which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither and ſlay them before me.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber likewiſe what I lately told you, that thoſe that would be free from the reach of Chriſts Diſcipline, are fitter to be ranked amongſt <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidells,</hi> than to be retained and priviledged as <hi>members of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.12. <hi>What have we to doe to judge them that are without? do we not judge them that are within?</hi> Thoſe that are <hi>without,</hi> indeed are free from the rod of Church-diſcipline, but thoſe that are <hi>within</hi> ought to be ruled by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third ſort of thoſe that hinder the work of Chriſt, in the <hi>ſaving of his people from their ſins,</hi> are <hi>Church-dividers</hi> ſuch as cauſe diviſions, and contentions in the Church of God. The Church is called Gods <hi>building,</hi> and Miniſters are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119718:78"/> called <hi>builders</hi> in Scripture, and the work of <hi>edification,</hi> or <hi>building,</hi> conſiſts in mortizing, pinning, and firmly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the parts together: to which the Apoſtle alludes, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2.— <hi>being knit together in love</hi> — <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is metaphoricall, and ſignifies to frame and fix together, as Carpenters firmely joyne beames, and other timber, for the ſtrengthening of their building. And if ſo, then unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, unpinning, and pulling downe, (for ſuch is the work of diviſion) doth not raiſe, but raze the building, &amp; is the ready way to the ruine and deſtruction of it. The materiall Temple was built by <hi>Solomon</hi> in a <hi>peaceable</hi> reigne, and by the <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>united</hi> endeavours of them that laboured in the Building: and when <hi>Ioſiah</hi> repaired the decaies of the Temple, he gave money to buy tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for <hi>couplings,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.11. But when axes and hammers were lifted up to hew down, and knock in pieces, how faſt was the beauty and ſtrength thereof deſtroyed! And how like is the voice of <hi>dividers</hi> to the voice of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Edom,</hi> who at the <hi>ſacking</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> cried, <hi>Raze it, raze it, even to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof,</hi> Pſal. 137.7.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:119718:78"/>
               <p>The Church alſo being here in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant condition, is fitly compared to an <hi>Army,</hi> an <hi>Army terrible with banners,</hi> Cant. 6.4, 10. An Army in the field, though the particular parts of it be committed to the overſight and conduct of ſeverall Captains, and other Officers, yet are they all <hi>one Army,</hi> under <hi>one Generall,</hi> who gives them all <hi>one word,</hi> and <hi>one field-mark,</hi> whereby his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers may know and owne each other in the Battel; and their beauty, ſtrength, ſafety, and terribleneſſe to the Enemy, lies in their order, unity, and cordiall cleaving each to other under their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, who is Commander of all. So is the Church of Chriſt <hi>one body,</hi> under Chriſt <hi>one Lord Generall,</hi> knowne by <hi>one Word,</hi> or profeſſion of Faith, ſigned by <hi>one Baptiſme,</hi> and animated by <hi>one Spirit,</hi> engaging in <hi>one Cauſe,</hi> and encouraged with <hi>one Hope,</hi> and by intire adhering each to other, all joyntly following the conduct of Chriſt the faithfull <hi>Captaine Generall</hi> of their <hi>Salvation,</hi> they become beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, ſtrong, ſafe, and the more formidable to their ſpiritall Enemies. And aptly to our purpoſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorteth, that we ſtand faſt in <hi>one

               <p>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a type of the true Church under the Goſpel.

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:119718:79"/> of their happy condition.

               <p>The Souldiers that parted the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, would rather caſt lots, than divide his ſeamleſſe Coat, but thoſe that cauſe diviſion and contention in the Church, ſpare not to rend, not the coat, but the myſticall body of Chriſt.

Verily Chriſt might take up a greater complaint againſt thoſe, who by their <hi>diviſions</hi> &amp; <hi>ſubdiviſions,</hi> would teare him <hi>limb-meale;</hi> and if <hi>Paul</hi> were ſmitten down unto the earth, when he heard the voice of Chriſt from heaven, methinks thoſe that are Dividers in the Church ſhould be pierced to the heart, if they did but conſider, and minde the <hi>many affectionate calls</hi> of Chriſt in his Word for <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>peace:</hi> and the <hi>ſad complaints</hi> by reaſon of <hi>diviſions</hi> and <hi>contentions,</hi> and his judgements threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the authors and promoters of them.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth fort of thoſe that hinder the <hi>ſalvation of others from their ſinnes,</hi> are ſuch as are <hi>men of evil practiſes,</hi> who by their <hi>bad examples,</hi> doe miſchief to many. Man is of an imitating nature, eſpecially in things that are evil; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall diſeaſes are infectious, and this is one maine reaſon, why <hi>admonition</hi> is required, in caſe of <hi>diſorderly walking,</hi> and <hi>excommunication</hi> enjoyned in caſe of <hi>obſtinate ſcandall,</hi> becauſe ſinfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are of a <hi>leavening,</hi> and <hi>infectious nature.

               </p>
               <p>As evil examples are dangerous in all, ſo more eſpecially in theſe four ſorts of perſons following: 1. Miniſters. 2. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and other perſons of note. 3. Superiors of neer relation. 4. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Profeſſors.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:119718:85"/>1. <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who are of ſcandalous converſation. The example of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> in evill, is very pernicious, becauſe he is ſent to <hi>teach</hi> the way of <hi>Salvation;</hi> and people will thinke, that if thoſe, whoſe <hi>calling</hi> it is to <hi>ſtudy,</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> the way of <hi>Salvation,</hi> doe theſe things, they may much more doe the ſame. Is it not found by ſad experience, that where people have lived under prophane, and ſuperſtitious Miniſters, they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo wickedly, and ſuperſtitiouſly bent, that it is a hard matter for a godly Miniſter, ſucceeding in ſuch a place, to win <hi>a little</hi> upon them <hi>in much time</hi> with the moſt ſerious and ſedulous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. Such evill Miniſters may preach, as long as they live, and doe but little good, unleſſe they amend their manners. Let their Sermons be never ſo finely ſpun, they will be but like <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope</hi>'s thred, no ſooner done, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done againe. To preach <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and practice <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> is but <hi>to doe,</hi> and <hi>undoe:</hi> a <hi>good Sermon</hi> is ſoon ravelled by the <hi>bad life</hi> of the preacher. Miniſters are <hi>Gods builders,</hi> and <hi>Gods building</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>both hands</hi> to the worke: but ill-living Miniſters, pull down more with the one hand, then they build with the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119718:86"/> other. They ſpend an houre or two in teaching people the way to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and the whole week beſides in leading them the way to utter <hi>deſtruction.</hi> If that ſaying be true, <hi>Longum iter ad do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinam per praecepta, per exempla vero breve,</hi> It is a long way to learn by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but ſhort by example; Then ſuch Miniſters teach their people the <hi>fartheſt way to heaven,</hi> but the <hi>neereſt way to hell:</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Plato,</hi> an ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, that he was crook-back'd, and his Schollers ſtrove to imitate him in that deformity. So doe people readily imitate the crooked and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med practiſes of their teachers.</p>
               <p>Such Miniſters are they, that harden the wicked in their wickedneſſe, grieve the godly, open the mouths of thoſe that vilifie and reproach our Miniſtry, and turn the weak and infirm out of the way, like the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> who by their wretched wickedneſſe, cauſed the people to <hi>abhorre the offering of the Lord.</hi> O that the judgement of God upon the houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> were well conſidered by ſuch ſcandalous wretches! yea, the judgement in part is already executed upon ſome of them, who are ſequeſtred from their livings, outed from their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119718:86"/> ſervice, and reduced to a needy craving condition for ſome ſmall employment. To ſuch may be applyed the woe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the wicked Scribes and Phariſees. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye ſhut up the kingdome of heaven againſt men; for ye neither goe in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entring to go in.</hi> O how <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>dreadfull</hi> will that ſaying be unto them one day! <hi>Their blood will I require at thy hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who are of bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, do much hurt. Magiſtrates are ſet to be a <hi>terrour to evil doers;</hi> but when they give <hi>bad example,</hi> they are <hi>teachers of evil doers.</hi> A <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s <hi>practiſe</hi> is taken for an <hi>authentick exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> If a <hi>Magiſtrate go</hi> to the Alehouſe, no marvell if the profane <hi>rabble run:</hi> if a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſit idly there <hi>an houre, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour drunkards</hi> will take leave to ſit by it <hi>all night:</hi> if a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſweare now and then, the <hi>common ſwearer</hi> will think himſelf ſecure. And no wonder, that ſome Magiſtrates are ſo ſlow to puniſh wickedneſſe in others, when they themſelves ſtand guilty of the ſame crimes. The evil examples, as well as the remiſsneſſe of many of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119718:87"/> in <hi>England,</hi> have been a great cauſe of ſwarming wickedneſſe in all parts of the Land: and the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the perſon in rule and authority is, the more pernicious is his evil exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the open ſins of <hi>great perſons</hi> (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) are not ſmall: the higher the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is, the farther it is ſeen: the bad examples of wicked <hi>Kings</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved infectious to all <hi>Iſrael</hi> generally; they are ſaid to <hi>ſin</hi> &amp; <hi>to make Iſrael to ſin.</hi> Yea, <hi>ſo great</hi> was the contagion of this diſeaſe, that <hi>following generations</hi> were infected by it: 'Tis no new thing for men to imitate the vices of their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, long after they are dead and gone. How was <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Idolatry imitated by divers ſucceeding Kings? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.26. <hi>Nadab, the ſon of Jeroboam did evil in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in his ſinne, wherewith he made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> Verſe 33.34. <hi>And Baaſha did evil in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his ſin wherewith he made Iſrael to ſinne.</hi> Thus we ſee how great and dangerous the influence of evil example is in great perſons: The Lord grant that ſucceeding generations may not imitate the horrible ſins, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119718:87"/> have been committed <hi>in our daies.</hi> The outing of ſcandalous Miniſters was judged neceſſary as a mean of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; I wonder how the outing of ſacandlous Magiſtrates came to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The evil example of ſuperiours of neer relation, is very hurtfull, as of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> and <hi>Maſters.</hi> If <hi>Maſters</hi> be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, their <hi>Servants</hi> will ſooner learne their <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> than their <hi>trades:</hi> Seven years are accounted little enough to learn a trade; but the trade of ſin is ſoon learned with little teaching, for there is an aptitude in nature to it. If <hi>Parents</hi> be ungodly, what more to be expected, than that their <hi>Children</hi> tread in their ſteps? how ſad is it little children babble out oaths and curſes, before they are able to ſpeak plain; but what is leſſe to be looked for? Is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that children of <hi>Welch parents</hi> ſpeak <hi>Welch,</hi> that children of <hi>Iriſh parents</hi> ſpeak <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and that every <hi>child</hi> ſpeaks the language of his <hi>parents,</hi> that educate him? Is not our native language there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called our <hi>mother tongue,</hi> becauſe we learnt it in the very <hi>lap?</hi> When we therefore heare <hi>children</hi> ſwearing, and curſing in the ſtreets, it is eaſie to gueſs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119718:88"/> what language their <hi>parents</hi> ſpeak. Children naturally grow like their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>feature;</hi> but moſt of all do they reſemble them in their <hi>ill-favoured conditions and practiſes:</hi> and when we ſee and hear the profaneneſſe of children, we may ſoon know of <hi>what breed</hi> they are of. Alas, how ſad is the account of ſuch parents, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived command from God <hi>to traine up their children in the nurture and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6.4.</note> but lead them on in waies of ungodlineſſe. If ſo heavy a judgement befell <hi>Eli,</hi> and his houſe, <hi>becauſe his ſons were vile, and he reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not,</hi> what a curſe abides upon the perſons and families of ſuch parents, who daily teach their children to ſinne againſt God, their own wicked lives being the copies their children write after. I doubt not but <hi>Eli</hi> gave his ſons good example; and when he heard of their miſcarriages, he rebuked them plainly, as you may read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.23, 24.25. And yet if notwithſtanding this, the Lord brought ſo heavy a judgement upon <hi>Eli</hi> and his houſe, becauſe he did no <hi>more</hi> to reſtrain them; What judgement (then) do ſuch parents bring upon themſelves &amp; their families, who are <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:119718:88"/> of their children by example to ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Evill example in thoſe that are <hi>eminent profeſſors,</hi> is very injurious to many ſoules. Their bad examples are of two ſorts: 1. In matters of Practiſe. 2. In matters of Opinion. Firſt, in <hi>matters of practice,</hi> which is alſo of two ſorts: Firſt more groſſe, and ſeldome miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. Secondly, more light and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Firſt, their more groſs (though ſeldome) miſcarriages, do much evill to divers. 1. Wicked men are hardned in their wickeneſſe, and more prejudiced againſt the waies of God, whereby their <hi>ſalvation from ſin</hi> is the more difficult. 2. They are emboldned the more to reproach and vilifie the waies and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>By this deed thou haſt given great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,</hi> ſaid the Lord by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> when he had fallen into thoſe ſins of Adultery and Murther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In miſcarriages leſſe, and more frequent. Herein the examples of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Chriſtians are a ſnare to many; as for example, Some that have been long, and ſome noted in the profeſſion of Religion, allow themſelves much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of vain talking, unſeemly jeſting,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119718:89"/> and ſometimes too far complying in evill company: Now how doth this 1. tend to confirm carnal Perſons in the like vanity? They will be ready to ſay ſuch and ſuch, that are good men, and know more than we, do thus and thus; why may not we do ſo too? 2. Weak Chriſtians are brought to allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more liberty than formerly they did, when they ſee profeſſors, far more eminent than themſelves, not to be ſo ſtrict, I doubt not but divers Chriſtians can, by experience ſay, the examples of <hi>good men</hi> in <hi>evil practiſes,</hi> have done them much wrong; and their lighter miſcarriages, in this reſpect, do more injury than their ſoule falls. There was little danger of godly mens being incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to imitate <hi>David</hi> in his Adultery and Murther: it would be matter of caution and lamentation, rather, becauſe the offences were foul and notorious, and conſcience would much reſiſt ſuch temptations at the firſt thought of them; but vain talking, idle jeſting, and the like, are looked on as ſmall, and no evils, and many are inclinable to think they may poſſibly be allowed, yet have ſome ſcruple and heſitancy, and will forbear ſuch vanity for feare of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119718:89"/> But when they heare an eminent Chriſtian taking liberty in the way they formerly feared, fleſh and blood will be ready to ſay, How needleſſe were ſuch feares and doubts? taking ſuch a mans example to be a reſolution of the doubt.</p>
               <p>Eminent and ancient profeſſors had great need to look to their wayes, and ſet a narrow watch before the dore of their lips.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In matters of Opinion, examples of eminent Profeſſors do much miſchief in theſe times. When a Cedar falls, it beats down many ſhrubs under it: when a noted perſon for parts and piety receiveth an opinion, how many are ſwayed by his example? And the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation in this is more dangerous, than in moſt practicall miſcarriages; for weak Chriſtians ordinarily know what is good or evill, in things of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and importance; but they want judgement to weigh controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted doctrines; and therefore follow the example of ſuch as they beſt eſteem. The proof of this is too full by the ſad experience of theſe times.</p>
               <p>A fift way of hindring the <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of people from their ſins,</hi> is by evill enticements, counſels and perſwaſions.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119718:90"/> Sinners, who are Satans agents, have their crafty allurements; hence <hi>Solomon</hi> gives warning, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. <hi>If ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not. Solomon</hi> deſcribes the manner how Harlots entice young men to commit folly; you may read it at your leiſure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.6. to 24. Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards have likewiſe their enticements to gain their companions, and when they are intangled, they have their various artifices to draw them in to exceſſe. Ale-ſellers alſo have their fetches to bring in cuſtomers to throw away their money, and precious time in ſwiniſh ſwilling. 'Tis a ſad complaint that I have heard of ſome of the wives of poor labourers, <hi>that their huſbands can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſe with a penny in their pockets, but they are drawne into one Alehouſe or another to ſpend it, while their wives and children want bread at home.</hi> (This the Magiſtrate may do well to look to.) But it is farre more ſad to conſider the wickedneſſe and miſchief of ſuch inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to the <hi>ſoules</hi> of thoſe that are intangled by them: they plead they cannot <hi>live</hi> and <hi>thrive,</hi> unleſſe they uſe ſuch means to draw their beer. But alas, what a <hi>living</hi> is it to live by the <hi>ſins</hi> of men, to deſtroy <hi>ſouls</hi> for a <hi>little gain!</hi>

The enticement of a wife is ſtrong with a husband, and the enticement of a husband is ſtrong with a wife: Sathan can do more by ſuch inſtruments, than by his immediate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, or by the threats of an enemy: therefore when <hi>Sathan</hi> had overcome <hi>Eve,</hi> he makes uſe of her to tempt her husband, as being a more likely way to prevaile, than to treat with him himſelf. Thus he made uſe of <hi>Solomons</hi> wives to draw him to Idolatry. For this cauſe the Lord forbad the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> to make marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119718:91"/> with Idolaters. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.3, 4. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou ſhalt not give unto his ſon, nor his daughter ſhalt thou take unto thy ſon: For they will turne away thy ſon from following me, that they may ſerve other Gods.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> giveth the like admonition to the Corinthians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.</hi> And, as the Lord warned the Iſraelites of the danger that would inſue upon the making of ſuch Marriages; ſo accordingly it befell them, when they tranſgreſſed this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Their ſtrange wives became a ſnare to them.</hi> Judges 3.5, 6. <hi>And the children of Iſrael dwelt among the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites, Hittites, Amorites, Periſites, Hivites, and Jebuſites; And they tooke their daughters to be their wives, and they gave their daughters to their ſons, &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their gods.</hi> It was <hi>Sampſons De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> that betrayed him into the hands of the Philiſtims. And how is it found by ſad experience, that ſuch as yoke themſelves unequally for carnall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, are much inſnared in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall condition. When Marriages are made, the infidelity or prophaneneſſe of the one party is not ſufficient to make
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119718:92"/> a neceſſary divorce; but the believing and ſpirituall are to do what they can to win the unbelieving and carnall: yet when perſons are free, they had beſt take heed how they intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

               <p>The laſt way I ſhall mention, of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the ſaving of people from their ſins, is by <hi>perſecution.</hi> Although now there is not (bleſſed be God) ſuch open perſecution with violence, as in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119718:92"/> dayes of Popiſh Kings and Rulers with fire and faggot, and other waies of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Yet, the ſcornes, deciſions, and abuſes, that have been offered to the waies and ſervants of God, have been a great means to hinder ſome, by diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them in the way &amp; to turn others out of the good way, wherein they were going. In theſe times (I confeſs) a ſlight <hi>forme of godlineſſe,</hi> and ſome ſmooth <hi>words,</hi> About matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſpecially the arguing of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in divers opinions, is in great credit, and much in faſhion, and <hi>the upper garment of Saint ſhip,</hi> is the very <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> of the times we live in. But the power of godlineſſe is but here and there found, and ſerious Chriſtian pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice hath little ſavour and acceptance. He that will be a <hi>Chriſtian indeed,</hi> ſhall be reviled by the <hi>profane party</hi> on the one hand for his <hi>preciſeneſſe</hi> and ſcorned and vilified by our <hi>Noveliſts</hi> on the other hand, as a <hi>Legalliſt</hi> and <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,</hi> as one that truſts to, and hopes to be ſaved by his duties.

                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:119718:93"/> It was a cruell practice of <hi>Paul,</hi> before his converſion, that he perſecuted the Saints, ſhutting many of them up in priſon, and gave his voyce againſt them when they were to be put to death, and that he puniſhed them oft in every Synagogue, and being excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly mad againſt them, perſecuted them even to ſtrong cities; but the moſt miſchievous of all was that he compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them <hi>to blaſpheme,</hi> Acts 26 10, 11. The other were but <hi>temporal ſufferings,</hi> this a <hi>spirituall miſchief.</hi> So now may we ſay, it was a murtherous practice in <hi>Bonner,</hi> and others, that burned the Saints in the daies of Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> but of far more evil conſequence is the ſin of thoſe, that by ſcoffs, and ſcornes at the power of godlineſſe, under ſpecious pretences, have deluded many ſimple ſoules, cauſing them to blaſpheme the ancient, tried, and approved wayes of God, and rejoice in it, as if they had <hi>done God good ſervice.</hi> O how doth this confirm the ungodly in the midſt of their wickedneſſe! and cauſe many, that began to minde Religion, to take up with a ſlight Antinomian profeſſion, and go no further! And how ſad is it to heare many talk of <hi>Goſpel liberty,</hi> and

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>FIrſt let me exhort you in generall to get your hearts deeply poſſeſſed with the conſideration of this truth,<note place="margin">1. Uſe of Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>That the great work of Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, is the ſaving of his people from their ſinnes.</hi> This will be of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the glory of God, and the good of your own and others ſoules, as will more fully appeare in the following diſcourſe. The not underſtanding, and want of conſideration of this, is the cauſe of great contentedneſſe in ſinne among profane and earnall perſons. They look onely upon <hi>judgement,</hi> as the great evill they are liable unto, as for their <hi>ſinnes,</hi> they love, and delight in them, as if there were no evil in them. So little do moſt conſider of the evill of <hi>ſinne,</hi> that were it not for fear of the <hi>judgement</hi> annexed to the Law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſinners, they would have no thoughts of ever-leaving their ſins: the Language of many poore car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119718:95"/> ſoules declares as much. Tell a profane perſon of his evill courſes, ſo as to convince him of his ſinne, he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he hopes he may repent hereafter, and God may have mercy on him at the laſt: The example of the Thief on the Croſſe much takes with him; but for preſent reformation he hath no minde to it. Tell me plainly, thou that liveſt in known ſinnes, being convinced in conſcience of the evill of them, and that yet there is no ſaving work wrought upon thy heart: Tell me, I ſay, and let Conſcience anſwer, when thou haſt had good motions upon thy heart from the Spirit of God in thy ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſeaſons, or when thou haſt been plainly ſhewed by ſome powerfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, what thy ſtate is, how ſinfull and damnable: Hath not thy deceitfull heart wedded to corruption, ſilenced the voice, and quieted the workings of conſcience, by telling it [this work of turning to God, and ſeeking his grace is indeed neceſſary to ſalvation, but this is a work that may be done hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſo it be done any time, tis well enough, though in ſickneſs, or old age.] And doth not this plainly ſhew, that thine ey is only upon the evil of <hi>ſuffring</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:119718:95"/> for ſin, &amp; not upon <hi>ſin it ſelf?</hi> for were <hi>ſin</hi> accounted a greter, or as great an <hi>evil</hi> as <hi>ſuffering,</hi> yea, were it accounted an <hi>evil of any moment at all,</hi> there would be no pleading for a little more ſlumber, a litle more folding of the hands to ſleep in ſin. Were ſinners as ſenſible of the evill of <hi>ſin,</hi> as of the pain of ſcorching flames, oh how would they awake, and rouze up themſelves &amp; plead no longer for the fleſh to delight it ſelf in ſenſual pleaſures!</p>
               <p>Is it not ignorance in this point, that is the cauſe why ſo many, in theſe times, will not account a Sermon of <hi>repentance</hi> or <hi>holineſſe,</hi> worth the hearing, and that the Preacher, that ſpends much time upon ſuch ſubjects, is eſteemed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ignorant of the myſteries of the Goſpel? Is not ignorance of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine the cauſe why ſo many ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, ſelf-ſending teachers, meddle ſo little with the propheticall, and kingly office of Chriſt, and inſiſt almoſt wholly upon his Prieſtly office, and handle that but by the halves too? They are much upon the ſatisfaction, which Chriſt hath made to God for ſinne by his fulfilling the Law, and ſuffering for us: but the purchaſe of <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> is little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of. Verily every office of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119718:96"/> Chriſt is very neceſſary to the <hi>ſaving of his people:</hi> His Propheticall office is neceſſary to their teaching and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the waies of holineſſe his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office is neceſſary for the ſubduing of rebellious luſts and affections, for the conducting of them; and leading them on in the paths of righteouſneſſe, and his purchaſe (as he is our Prieſt) of <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> is as neceſſary as his obtaining <hi>pardoning grace</hi> for us.</p>
               <p>The not laying of this to heart, is ſurely the cauſe of ſo much ſlightneſſe and remiſsneſſe, even in many of the children of God themſelves in their whole ſpirituall courſe. Tell me truly, thou that feareſt God, and diſſemble no longer to thy own injury, and Gods diſhonour, Haſt thou not many times ſaid thus in thy heart [I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded my eſtate is good before God, that I have true grace, and an intereſt in the precious merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and though I be not ſo carefull, watchfull, and ſpirituall, as I might be, though I give way to ſuch and ſuch leſſer evils, and neglect ſuch and ſuch ſmaller du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet having an intereſt in Chriſt, who is able to ſave me to the uttermoſt, all theſe will be pardoned, and done
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119718:96"/> away in the day of account, and being not under a covenant of works, but of free-grace for the remiſſion of ſinnes, I need not be ſo very ſcrupulous.] Whence now comes ſuch evill and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſonings in thy heart, but from hence, that thou little conſidereſt that the great work and care of Chriſt is to ſave thee from thy <hi>ſinnes?</hi> Thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt upon <hi>ſuffering</hi> as the greateſt evil, and upon <hi>ſinne</hi> as little in compariſon of it; thou thinkeſt <hi>free-grace</hi> is <hi>chiefly,</hi> yea, almoſt <hi>wholly,</hi> if not <hi>onely,</hi> to be admired in the <hi>remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> and magnified in the <hi>juſtification</hi> of Gods Elect diminiſhing his grace in their <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</hi> O how exceedingly is God diſhonoured, not onely by <hi>wicked men,</hi> but even by his own <hi>children</hi> alſo, for want of rightly conſidering wherein their <hi>ſalvation</hi> lies! O learn now, if thou haſt not hitherto conſidered it, <hi>that it is the great work of Chriſt to ſave his people from their ſinnes:</hi> And to that end weigh well the arguments confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And to the end thou maiſt be further helped in thy underſtanding of this truth, of ſo great importance, ſtudy againe, and conſider better very many
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119718:97"/> Scriptures, that ſpeak of the work of <hi>ſalvation</hi> by Chriſt, and ſee whether thou haſt not exceedingly ſtraitned the ſenſe and meaning of them, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them to ſpeak of <hi>ſalvation</hi> from the <hi>fruits</hi> of ſin onely, when they ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend <hi>ſalvation from ſinne</hi> onely. Did not theſe words in the text, <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes,</hi> and theſe words, <hi>Behold the lambe of God, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world,</hi> ſeem to thee to be meant onely of the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment of ſinne?</hi> O learn now more clearly and fully to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſenſe of Scripture concerning <hi>Goſpel-grace,</hi> and know, that Chriſts <hi>ſaving</hi> his people, by <hi>ſanctifying</hi> them, as well as <hi>juſtifying</hi> them, is the very ſtream both of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Now let it be conſidered, whether the offers, before mentioned, be onely of <hi>pardoning grace,</hi> and the bleſſedneſſe, Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, be to ſuch as hunger and thriſt after his <hi>juſtifying righteouſneſſe onely;</hi> or whether <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> is not here

                  <hi>principally</hi> (I do not ſay, only) intended.

When a wicked impenitent ſinner lies upon his death-bed, and expreſſeth his deſire, that God would pardon his ſin for the ſake of Chriſt, and juſtifie him through his righteouſneſs, we have no reaſon to think that he <hi>diſſembles,</hi> not meaning what he ſpeaks, for who would be willing to be condemned? But thoſe gracious offers hold forth to us both
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119718:101"/> 
                  <hi>pardoning</hi> and <hi>ſanctifying grace;</hi> and <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> more <hi>especially:</hi> Hear <hi>John</hi> explaining the invitation of Chriſt forementioned, <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38, 39. <hi>But this he spake of the Spirit,</hi> which they that believe on him ſhould receive. And what Spirit is this, but the holy Ghoſt, which is our Sanctifier?</p>
               <p>Here let me ask the ſound Believer, What haſt thou hungred and thirſted after? what hath been thy deſire? didſt thou never earneſtly deſire <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace?</hi> doſt thou not ſtill finde it to be thy greateſt want? doſt thou not daily beg it at the hand of God? would the aſſurance of <hi>a pardon</hi> content thy ſoule, if it were poſſible to obtain it without <hi>ſanctifying grace?</hi> I know it cannot be.</p>
               <p>Thus likewiſe ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Theſe expreſſions are alſo metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and (reteining the Metaphor) what is the <hi>burden</hi> here ſpoken of?

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119718:102"/> come to Chriſt for eaſe, I anſwer, that <hi>coming</hi> is alſo a metaphorical expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we cannot underſtand it of a <hi>locall motion.</hi> To come to Chriſt for eaſe, is but to be willing to be eaſed by him, and to accept of his help: And what reaſon have we to think, that <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> were unwilling that Chriſt ſhould eaſe them of that horrour and judgement their ſouls lay under? Yea, let me adde, I doubt not but all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell would be willingly eaſed of the intolerable burden of Gods eternal vengeance. If you ſay, But there is no promiſe made to <hi>Devils,</hi> but to <hi>Men;</hi> I anſwer, it is true, but ſure the <hi>men,</hi> to whom this <hi>reſt</hi> belongs, have other kind of deſires than what the <hi>Devils</hi> have. And in this, as <hi>James</hi> compares the <hi>faith</hi> that is not ſaving with the <hi>faith of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> Jam. 2.19 ſo may I compare the <hi>deſire</hi> that is not ſaving, with the <hi>deſire of Devils.</hi> The <hi>burden</hi> then here ſpoken of, is the <hi>burden of ſin it ſelfe,</hi> with the wrath of God, as the fruit of it, and thoſe that have found, or ſhall find, eaſe by Chriſt, are ſuch as groan under the intolerable burden of <hi>ſin it ſelf,</hi> and not meerly under the <hi>burden of wrath.</hi> And here I might alſo appeal to the ſincere
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119718:102"/> Chriſtian, Wouldſt thou think thy ſelf ſufficiently eaſed of thy <hi>burden,</hi> if Chriſt ſhould <hi>onely</hi> deliver thee from <hi>eternall torments?</hi> would the <hi>body of ſin</hi> be <hi>no burden to thee?</hi> would it be a <hi>pleaſure</hi> to bear it about thee?

               <p>We ſhall now conſider ſome other texts of Scripture: When <hi>Paul</hi> ſtates the doctrine of <hi>ſalvation</hi> by <hi>free grace,</hi> he magnifies free grace mainly in the <hi>ſanctification,</hi> and not meerely in the <hi>juſtification</hi> of the ſinner. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through faith, and not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> What this <hi>ſalvation</hi> here ſpoken of is, let the Apoſtle himſelfe declare in the foregoing verſes. Ver. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>And you hath he quickned, who were dead in trespaſſes and ſins, wherein in time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world— but God, who is rich in mercy, for his great mercy, wherewith he loved
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119718:103"/> us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt (by grace ye are ſaved.)</hi> In which verſes you plainly ſee, that Grace is magnified up in the quickning from <hi>death in treſpaſſes and ſins, to live the life of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tit.</hi> c. 33. to 7. <hi>For we our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hatefull, and hating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But after that the kindneſſe, and love of God our Saviour towards man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, not by works of righteouſneſſe, which we have done; but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renuing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> In which he ſhews, firſt, what was our <hi>miſery,</hi> to wit, a ſtate of fooliſhneſſe, diſobedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ver. 3. Secondly, he declares the moving cauſe of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, not our works, but his mercy, <hi>according to his mercy he ſaved us,</hi> to wit, from the forementioned miſery, and that is done <hi>by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renuing of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. And herein the <hi>kindneſſe and love of God our Saviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119718:103"/> man appeareth,</hi> ver. 4. Juſtifying grace is afterwards mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>In the third, fourth, and fifth chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the third to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks chiefly, and almoſt wholly of <hi>juſtifying grace.</hi> But the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that is, becauſe he there diſputed the queſtion of <hi>juſtification</hi> with thoſe, that ſought it by a legal righteouſneſs of their own; &amp; therefore in this caſe it was neceſſary for him (firſt) to keep to the queſtion in hand: yet, in the following chapters he ſhews the vertues of Chriſts <hi>death,</hi> for the <hi>killing of ſinne,</hi> and of his <hi>reſurrection</hi> for our <hi>ariſing to newneſſe of life.</hi> Rom. 6. And that <hi>they that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh with the affections and lusts,</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
               <p>But where no controverſie lies in his way, but the doctrine of ſalvation is intirely to be handled, he ſtates <hi>ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mainly</hi> in the <hi>ſanctification</hi> of the ſoul, as appeares in the foregoing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: And when <hi>Paul</hi> accounts all but loſſe, and dung, that he might win Chriſt, <hi>Phil</hi> 3.8. it was not meerly that he might be found in the righteouſneſs which is through faith in Chriſt, but alſo that he might know Chriſt, and the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119718:104"/> 
                  <hi>power of his reſurrestion, and the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his ſuffering, being made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his death.</hi> And towards the full attainment of this, it is that he preſſeth forwards, ver. 12.13. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to direct him what to teach, as the moſt neceſſary doctrine, and what he ſhould ſee others teach alſo, he directs him to teach the practice of godlineſſe. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>But refuſe profane and old wives fables, and exerciſe thy ſelf rather unto godlineſſe. For bodily exerciſe profiteth little, but godlineſſe is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and that which is to come:</hi> He addes, ver. 9. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, &amp; worthy of all acceptation.</hi> And backing it with a further argument, ver. 10. he addes again, ver. 11. <hi>Theſe things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and teach.</hi> And in the fifth chap. with the former part of the ſixt, having directed him how to teach the duties of perſons in their ſeverall relations, he addes, <hi>Theſe things teach and exhort,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>And if any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholſome words, even
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119718:104"/> the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine, which is according to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions,</hi> &amp;c. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that are now vented againſt the power of godlineſſe, are but the fruit of the proud <hi>dotage</hi> of the times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live; for the myſterie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is called the myſterie of godlineſſe. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>And without controverſie great is the myſterie of godlineſſe, God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Let it be further conſidered, that when <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſedly handleth the doctrine of Gods <hi>ſpeciall diſtinguiſhing grace,</hi> he oppoſeth <hi>ſaving grace</hi> (as I formerly obſerved) to <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſin,</hi> rather than <hi>periſhing for ſin.</hi> Ro. 9.18. <hi>He will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> I might give you divers other Scriptures, but theſe may ſuffice, being thus opened, to help you in the better underſtanding of the doctrine of Saving grace.</p>
               <p>Conſider well of theſe, and ſee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy <hi>ſalvation</hi> lies, and labour in the uſe of all the meanes that God affords thee for the ſaving of thy ſoul from ſin: Hear diligently, pray earneſtly, watch narrowly, work out thy ſalvation with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119718:105"/> fear and trembling, and ſtrive in good earneſt, if thou meanſt to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But methink I heare ſome alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whiſpering, what, muſt we be ſaved by our</hi> graces, <hi>and</hi> duties? <hi>What kinde of Popiſh doctrine is this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the great Objection whereby Sathan, that grand Deceiver, hath hardned many againſt the moſt preſſing arguments of the moſt ſerious Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, to holineſſe of life. Upon this one ſlender cavil, many, for fear of <hi>Popery,</hi> are become <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> I may better ſay, profeſſed <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines:</hi> And for fear of being <hi>their own Saviours,</hi> have refuſed to be <hi>ſaved by the purifying blood and ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But to ſpeak more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſatisfactorily to this point, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with me theſe few propoſitions following:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Prop.</note>1. Mans Miſery conſiſts of two parts, 1. Sin. 2. Condemnation for Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mans Salvation conſiſts of two parts (oppoſite to thoſe two evils) 1. Sanctification, which is his Salvation fron Sin. 2. Pardon of Sin and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, whereby he is delivered from
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119718:105"/> Guilt and Condemnation: And both theſe are eſſentially neceſſary to mans Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Juſtification and Sanctification are both concomitant, and inſeparable twins of unſpeakable Mercy and Free-grace, proceeding from the tender bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As no mans Juſtification is the cauſe of his Sanctification, ſo no mans Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the cauſe of his Juſtification; but both are alike, the proper fruits of the forementioned grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As no man is ſaved from <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>condemnation,</hi> but by being <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>juſtified,</hi> ſo no man is ſaved from <hi>ſin,</hi> but by being <hi>ſanctified.</hi> And thus <hi>ſalvation</hi> depends upon <hi>ſanctification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And what danger is in this Doctrine? I am ſure the <hi>ruine</hi> of the <hi>ſoule</hi> depends upon the contrary.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Juſtification</hi> is a <hi>relative</hi> change wrought <hi>without us, Sanctification</hi> is a <hi>reall</hi> work wrought <hi>upon us. Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Author,</hi> but <hi>Man</hi> is the <hi>Subject</hi> of Sanctification: Or (to ſpeak to the meaneſt capacity) it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifeth,</hi> it is <hi>Man</hi> that is <hi>ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. By this <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> of Chriſt,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119718:106"/> thoſe that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, have a principle of ſpiritual life put within them, and maintained, whereby they are enabl'd to live the life of grace, to the glory and honour of God.</p>
               <p>Now muſt we be afraid of ſetting forth in the ſtrength of grace communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, leſt we diſhonour the work of Chriſt? Is Chriſt diſhonoured by our walking, running, ſtriving, preſſing forward in the waies of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? When Chriſt raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Grave, he wrought a reall miracle in cauſing his ſoule to return into his body, whereby he received life again. Here <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>Author</hi> of this Miracle, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> was the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> upon whom it was wrought. It was <hi>Chriſt</hi> that <hi>gave life,</hi> by cauſing the ſoul to return into the body; it was <hi>Lazarus</hi> that <hi>received life,</hi> and his ſoul that returned, was the immediate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life. Now when Chriſt had given life unto him, and called <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> would <hi>Lazarus</hi> have done well to anſwer [Lord if I come forth, and walk upon my own legs, thy power will not be manifeſted in my reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the work will not appeare to be a reall miracle.] Would it not have

Certainly, the more readily he came forth, and the more he walked, worked, or performed any actions of life, the more fully was the miracle, and therein the glory of Chriſt manifeſt to the world. And thus it is in our ſpirituall reſurrection from death in ſin.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I well remember, ever ſince I knew what a Sermon meant (till theſe late years) that the moſt thundring, rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, ſin diſcovering, heart-ſearching Preachers, were moſt highly prized, and followed by all that were eſteemed god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the wicked and profane were wont to call them <hi>damnation preachers,</hi> and deſired to heare ſuch as would preach them a Sermon of <hi>mercy.</hi> I wonder now, how it comes to paſſe that ſo many <hi>profeſſors,</hi> in theſe times, are fallen in with the profane multitude, to revile ſuch meſſengers of Chriſt: Sure there is a harmony between the <hi>theory</hi> (at leaſt) of the one, and <hi>practice</hi> of the other. The Antinomian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors plead <hi>grace is free,</hi> and God hath ſo revealed himſelf, that we need not doubt of his love; it doth not become a <hi>Goſpel-spirit</hi> to repent of ſin, or grieve for any miſcarriages, their ſins were all long ſince done away in Chriſt; neither ought they ſo much as once queſtion their ſpiritual ſtate; neither ſhould Miniſters preach any thing but Free-grace and mercy in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And the wicked and profane ſay, [God is mercifull, and Chriſt died to ſave ſinners, and hereupon take liberty
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119718:115"/> to go on in ſin, impenitently, never queſtioning their ſpiritual condition, but hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, as well as the beſt.] And the Antinomian ſort of teachers will fit them for preaching, according to their own hearts deſire. Either all our <hi>old</hi> Profeſſors, or theſe <hi>new ones,</hi> are much miſtaken. But you will ſay, Theſe are times of greater light, and many of our young Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors now ſee that, that our ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours underſtood not in former times. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are times wherein Profeſſors <hi>are</hi> more <hi>light</hi> than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but whether they <hi>have</hi> more <hi>light,</hi> I much queſtion. Some men have (or at leaſtwiſe think they have) much <hi>light</hi> in their <hi>heads,</hi> but little in their <hi>hearts,</hi> and their Religion is much in <hi>controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> but little in <hi>the life,</hi> and <hi>power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi> 2. <hi>Light</hi> is of two ſorts, Firſt, the light of <hi>bare knowledge,</hi> and if <hi>this</hi> be the <hi>light</hi> ſo much boaſted of, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> and <hi>damned in hell,</hi> may boaſt more, for they <hi>know more</hi> than <hi>all the Saints</hi> upon earth. Secondly, there is the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> ſeated chiefly in the <hi>heart,</hi> and ſhining forth in the life and converſation; and this (if I miſtake not, yea, if Chriſt miſtake not) is the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119718:116"/> 
                  <hi>true light</hi> of the Goſpel, that ſhines to the honour of God. Mat. 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your father which is in heaven.</hi> And of this ſort of <hi>light</hi> our <hi>late profeſſors</hi> are farre more barren, than <hi>thoſe of former yeares.</hi> If there be now <hi>more light in the head,</hi> there is <hi>leſſe in the heart</hi> and <hi>life;</hi> and <hi>light in the head</hi> will be but an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>darkneſſe in the heart.</hi> The Servant that <hi>knew</hi> his Maſters will and <hi>did it not,</hi> was to be beaten with <hi>many ſtripes:</hi> Yet I much queſtion, whether <hi>this light</hi> ſo much gazed after, be light from the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe,</hi> or not. There is a ſort of wandring light in the night ſeaſon, which ignorant people call by divers names, but Philoſophers call it <hi>ignis fatuus, fooles fire,</hi> becauſe ignorant and fooliſh people when they ſee it, wonder, and are amazed at it, and are led by it out of their way into pits and ditches, and loſe themſelves, and afterward uſually ſay, they were <hi>led by a Spirit,</hi> not underſtanding that it is but, a vapour ariſing out of the earth. So there is a <hi>ſort of light,</hi> which <hi>ignorant profeſſors</hi> admiring, wander after, out of the way of truth, into many pits of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119718:116"/> digging, yet they take themſelves to be <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> while they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, that this light is not from above, but is earthly, ſenſuall, devilliſh. But I return to anſwer more fully to the Objection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If by the <hi>voice of the Law</hi> you mean preaching <hi>juſtification</hi> by the <hi>law,</hi> as a <hi>covenant of works,</hi> ſo as by our <hi>own works,</hi> to be juſtified either in whole, or in part; I bleſſe God I never heard any ſuch preaching in all my life, nor (I believe) any of you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſuppoſe by the Law, you mean <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> not the <hi>law of ceremonies,</hi> for no man preacheth ſuch doctrine among us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you conceive that thoſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the Law, till the coming of Chriſt, were under a Covenant <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> and <hi>eſſentially</hi> different from the covenant of <hi>grace,</hi> under the Goſpel, you do but groſly miſtake: For the <hi>covenant of God</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>his ſeed,</hi> and the covenant now made with the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and <hi>their ſeed,</hi> is one and the ſame. Hence, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3.9. <hi>They which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> Hence likewiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. he proves juſtification by faith, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s juſtification.

               <p n="4">4. If you think that thoſe that lived under the Law, did not ſo clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the promiſes of Grace, but were more plentifully threatned with judgements. It is true: 1. There is a <hi>graduall</hi> difference of light, or of the manifeſtation of the grace of Chriſt <hi>now,</hi> from what was <hi>then.</hi> 2. Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were more plentifully threatned in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> then in the <hi>New.</hi> 3. Yet as the <hi>Law</hi> threatned more <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,</hi> ſo the threats were more of <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Judgements.</hi> Deut. 28.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> threatens more <hi>spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly,</hi> ſo it threatens more <hi>heavily,</hi> and <hi>dreadfully</hi> with <hi>spirituall, and eternall vengeance.</hi> As one milſtone will weigh down many pibbles: So one <hi>Gospell-threat</hi> will overpoiſe <hi>many</hi> of the <hi>curſes threatned in the Law.</hi> There is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. a Catalogue of curſes containing no leſſe then fifty two verſes: And that <hi>one</hi> Goſpell threatning, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. is <hi>farre</hi> more dreadfull then <hi>all of them:</hi> doe but weigh, and conſider it. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119718:118"/> taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> What are <hi>all temporall Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in compariſon of this <hi>everlaſting deſtruction</hi> here denounced againſt all thoſe that obey not the Goſpell? The voice of the <hi>Law-threatnings</hi> is but as the <hi>ruſhing of winds, leſſe terrible, but more frequent:</hi> But the voice of the <hi>Gospel threatnings</hi> is like the <hi>loudeſt thunder-claps</hi> from heaven, <hi>more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,</hi> though <hi>more ſeldom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. As the <hi>morall Law</hi> it ſelf is not yet aboliſhed; ſo all the <hi>threatnings</hi> of the Law for morall diſobedience, are ſtill in force alſo. I doubt not but warre, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, poverty, and the like are now Judgments from God upon the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: for as godlineſſe hath promiſe of the life that now is, and that which is to come; ſo ungodlineſſe is threatned both with the judgments of this life, and that which is to come. And if the threatnings of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> are ſtill in force; and <hi>more terrible ones</hi> are denounced in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> againſt impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners, muſt a Preacher <hi>paſſe them

To offer <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and to <hi>conferre it</hi> upon all thoſe that believe and obey it. 2. To denounce and pour out <hi>vengeance</hi> upon all that are unbelieving, and diſobedient. As in the Law of our Land; the <hi>first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of the Law of our land, is the <hi>good</hi> of the Subject, that men may be obedient to it, &amp; protected by it: but the <hi>ſecond intention</hi> of the Law, is to puniſh the diſorderly; and the penalties are annexed to the Law, and publiſhed with it, that Obedience may be the more readily yeilded, and the tranſgreſſors of the Law may know what to truſt to. So
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119718:119"/> the <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>direct intention</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is the <hi>ſalvation of the ſinner:</hi> yet the <hi>judgement</hi> of God upon the diſobedient, is written and publiſhed in the Goſpel, that Obedience may be the more readily given to Chriſt, and that his enemies that will not be ſubject to him, may know what to look for at his hands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I hope Chriſt and his Apoſtles were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> not <hi>legall preachers:</hi> let us ſee how they preached, 1. Chriſt preached repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and deſtruction to the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Luke 13.3, 5. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> He preached moſt <hi>terrible woes</hi> to them, that they rejected the Goſpel-meſſage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. He preacheth no leſs than <hi>eight woes</hi> in one Chapter. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 25, 27, 29. He threatneth with the <hi>damnation of hell;</hi> ver. 23. <hi>Ye Serpents, ye generation of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell? And the worm that never dieth, and the fire that never goeth out?</hi> Mark 9.44, 46, 48. <hi>And this is the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 3.19. See alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 11.42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 52. if preaching ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſtinate ſinners be <hi>legall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</hi> you will be conſtrained to call
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119718:120"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> a very <hi>legall Preacher,</hi> if you do but read and conſider his Sermons.</p>
               <p>Conſider likewiſe the preaching of the Apoſtles. <hi>Peter</hi> preached a Sermon (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.) that <hi>pierced</hi> the Jewes to <hi>the heart,</hi> ver. 37. <hi>Paul</hi> preached a <hi>rouzing Sermon</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſſe, temperance,</hi> and <hi>judgement to come,</hi> that made <hi>Felix tremble</hi> to hear it, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. And <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>beloved Diſciple,</hi> that lay in Jeſus his <hi>boſome,</hi> and knew <hi>much</hi> of his <hi>heart,</hi> tells us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>The fearfull, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, and abominable, and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars ſhall have their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</hi> Read alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. ch. 2. to ver. 10.1 <hi>Corin</hi> 6.9 ch. 10. &amp; 11. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.2. 1, 2, 3. c. 12. 29 <hi>Iam</hi> 5.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>As Chriſts <hi>ordinary practice</hi> was a <hi>pattern</hi> for <hi>all Chriſtians (Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29.) So his <hi>preaching</hi> is a <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> for thoſe that are <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi> We muſt learn of Chriſt <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> to preach. And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am alſo of Chriſt,</hi> to wit, in ordinary converſation: So
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119718:120"/> may it be ſaid of his preaching alſo, to thoſe that are Miniſters; we muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, as he imitated Chriſt in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he preached: And if to preach as Chriſt, and his Apoſtles did, be <hi>legall preaching,</hi> I deſire to live and die a <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall preacher.</hi> And however many eſteeme of it, I had rather (as I have formely told you) that my <hi>tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,</hi> than ever I ſhould, with a <hi>pleaſing voice, flatter</hi> you in your <hi>ſinnes,</hi> and ſing you aſleep in the midſt of <hi>carnall ſecurity.</hi> O how dreadfull is that ſaying, <hi>Ezek</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Son of man I have made thee a watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael; therefore heare the word from my mouth, and give them warning from me, when I ſay unto the wicked, thou ſhalt ſurely die, and thou giveſt him not warning, nor speakeſt to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to ſave his life, the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity: but his blood will I require at thy hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it be further conſidered, That when there was more <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>home preaching,</hi> which was the manner of the Lords Prophets, not many yeares ſince, there was farre leſſe pride, cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, contention, hypocriſie, and other
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119718:121"/> evils among profeſſors, and farre more true zeale for God, humility, meekneſs, tender-heartedneſſe one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſincerity, than can be now found among them. O how <hi>unlike</hi> are <hi>we</hi> now to <hi>thoſe Saints,</hi> that lived <hi>twenty yeares ſince! we</hi> have indeed the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> more frequent in our <hi>mouths</hi> than they; but <hi>they</hi> had farre more of the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> in their <hi>hearts</hi> and lives than <hi>we:</hi> 'Twere well if we had <hi>leſſe</hi> of the <hi>name,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> of the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Saints indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to cloſe up the Anſwer, let us conſider what may be the reaſon why it is not <hi>now</hi> meet that the judgements of God upon ſinners, ſhould be preached among us; it is not becauſe men have more <hi>tender conſciences</hi> than ordinary, (although tender conſciences are much talked of) that nothing ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them but <hi>lenitives</hi> and <hi>cordials</hi> from the promiſes of God: But becauſe men are grown more <hi>tender</hi> of their <hi>ſins,</hi> and are loath to have their <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lahs</hi> diſturbed that lodg in their boſoms. But let every faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt remember that ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 1.13. <hi>Rebuke them ſharply, that they may be ſound in the faith.</hi> And let
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119718:121"/> me tell thee, whoſoever thou art, that wouldſt have thy <hi>corruptions</hi> ſo <hi>tenderly</hi> dealt with, the Lord will either <hi>break thy heart for ſin here,</hi> and bring thee to himſelf as a ſincere convert, or elſe he will <hi>grind thee to pouder hereafter;</hi> thou ſhalt not long <hi>ſleep</hi> thus in a <hi>whole skin;</hi> thou hadſt beſt therefore look about thee quickly.</p>

Is not the caſe alike, as to thy ſpirituall condition? No man, but he, that is deſperately ſet to loſe his ſoule (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) can be perſwaded from praying to the Lord for help.

Was it not to the wicked that the Lord ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is neere?</hi> See ver. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him.</hi> And is it not charged upon the <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> as their <hi>greater ſin,</hi> that <hi>they call not upon the Lord,</hi> Pſ. 14.4.

Let me put this queſtion to thee, and conſider well what anſwer thy conſcience will make. Suppoſe it were poſſible for thee to go on freely in <hi>ſin,</hi> without danger of <hi>puniſhment;</hi> that there were no penalty to be executed upon the impenitent tranſgreſſors of the Law; that there were no ſuch thing as <hi>everlaſting condemnation,</hi> or <hi>temporal judgement;</hi> couldſt thou then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to go on, and take thy courſe in <hi>ſin,</hi> without ſerious ſeeking to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it? If thou couldſt, <hi>thy heart is not yet right in the ſight of God, thou art in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and not in a <hi>ſtate of ſalvation.</hi> For to fear <hi>ſin meerly,</hi> for fear of <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is not <hi>properly</hi> to feare <hi>ſin at all,</hi> but <hi>wrath onely;</hi> and this is but a <hi>ſervile,</hi> or <hi>ſlaviſh fear.</hi> I doubt not but the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned</hi> on the one hand, and the reward <hi>promiſed</hi> on the other hand, are motives needfull for our help; but the very evill that is <hi>in ſin it ſelfe,</hi> is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ſo great,</hi> that the conſideration of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119718:136"/> that alone worketh ſtrongly in all that truly believe. He that could think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well enough with profits, pleaſures, honours, if he might have a continued enjoyment of them, without ever being called to an account before Gods tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, is, as yet, but an <hi>unhappy man;</hi> for as yet he doth not hate <hi>ſin, as ſin,</hi> or for it ſelf; nor out of any <hi>true love</hi> to the wayes of <hi>holineſſe.</hi> The Scholler that would be willingly playing all the day long; but leaves his ſport a while, and learneth a little, for feare of his Maſters <hi>rod onely,</hi> is no enemy to Idleneſſe, or true lover of Learning.

               <p>HAving thus farre ſpoken of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>ſin</hi> it ſelf, to wit, in work of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> I might here proceed alſo to handle the doctrine of <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification</hi> of the ſinner by Jeſus Chriſt, which are alſo included in the words of the Text. For as Chriſt ſaves his people from their <hi>ſins;</hi> ſo alſo from the <hi>eternal wrath of God,</hi> which was due unto them for ſin. But of that I have heretofore ſpoken from another Text: And what I have already ſpoken upon this, was that, which I eſpecially inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded when I firſt entred upon it. Yet it will not be amiſſe, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the whole work of mans Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and for your better help againſt ſome miſtakes of theſe times, if I ſhew you in a few Propoſitions by way of <hi>Parallel,</hi> how the Lord carrieth on the whole work of mans Salvation in both parts joyntly from the firſt to the laſt. To which I ſhall annexe a few Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>God did at once, &amp; that from eternity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 1.</note> decree the whole, and perfect Salvation of all his Elect, both from <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:119718:159"/> by his Son Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Corol.</note>Therefore we can no more argue our eternal <hi>Juſtifacation</hi> (becauſe it was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally decreed) then our eternall <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> or <hi>glorification.</hi> And if there be any ſuch thing, as the <hi>actual Juſtification</hi> of the elect from eternity, how doth the Scripture (that every mouth may be ſtopped) make all the world to become <hi>guilty</hi> before God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. And to what end ſhould God give us <hi>promiſes</hi> of the pardon, and remiſſion of ſins? Promiſes are of good things to come, <note n="m" place="margin">The Promiſes are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of Gods will, concerning good to be received, and evill to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Leigh</hi> on the Promiſes, p. 5. <hi>Promiſsio Dei eſt denunora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio futurorum bonorum nobis dandorum,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 2.</note>When Chriſt undertook the work of the <hi>Salvation</hi> of his people, he did at once undertake both their <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification, Heb.</hi> 10. to <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>

               <p>Therefore we can no more conclude,<note place="margin">Corol.</note> that we were actually <hi>pardoned,</hi> and <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> immediately upon the price that Chriſt paid, then that we were actually <hi>Sanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt in his Goſpell-offer tendereth himſelf both for our <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 4.</note> and commandeth us ſo to accept of him, requiring Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſincere obedience of all thoſe, that will be his: And he that will not imbrace him for <hi>Sanctification,</hi> ſhall not have him for <hi>Juſtification;</hi> he that is not willing to have his ſins <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,</hi> ſhall not have them <hi>pardoned:</hi> Chriſt will be a <hi>whole Saviour,</hi> or <hi>no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> Acts. 3.19.

               <p>Hence that offer <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins upon condition of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and converſion to God, and all others in Scripture of the like nature, are not the leſſe, but the more free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe conditionall. For the condition
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:119718:160"/> that is required is our priviledge. Our turning from God by ſin is our greateſt miſery; and our converſion, or turning to God in holineſſe, is our greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, (as you have formerly heard) 2. what the Lord requireth of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he communicateth to them his grace for the performance of, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as in the next propoſition. So that the condition required doth but injoyne us to accept of a double bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and oblige us to minde our <hi>whole Salvation,</hi> to wit from <hi>ſin,</hi> as well as <hi>ſuffering;</hi> that God may be the more glorified in the riches of his grace.</p>
               <p>They are therefore utterly miſtaken, yea they much eclipſe, and leſſen Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell grace, and turne moſt part of the Goſpell into Law, who call all conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall promiſes the voice of the Law, and not of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a King ſhould offer to a poor unworthy ſubject two moſt precious Jewels joyned together in a golden link, &amp; tendring them to him freely, tels him withall, [Thou ſhalt not have the one without the other, but take them both together, as they are tendred.] Would it be wel for this poor man to ſay [The gift
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:119718:160"/> would be more free, &amp; of greater boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if I might break that golden link, and take one of the jewels without the other? it is a diminiſhing of the freeneſſe of the gift, that you injoyne me to take them both.] This is plainely the caſe. The Lord hath in the Goſpell individually linked together both his <hi>pardoning,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifying</hi> grace; but fleſh and blood would fain break this golden link. We are naturally willing to have our ſins pardoned, that we may be freed from ſuffering: but nature is an enemy to <hi>Sanctifying</hi> grace.</p>

                  </note> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons the ſins that are paſt, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſinner, when he doth actually convert, or bring him home from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God; ſo that thoſe that come unto Chriſt, or believe in him, are then made actuall partakers, both of <hi>Iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Sanctifying</hi> grace: of <hi>Iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> grace by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe; of <hi>Sanctifying</hi> grace by the reall communication of his grace unto them: That as all the children of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> are ſubject to ſin, and miſery, in the day of their generation, and birth; ſo all the children of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt,) are delivered
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:119718:161"/> from a ſtate both of ſin, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in the day of their regeneration, and new-birth.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> as Chriſts inſtrument, was ſent to the Gentiles, <hi>To open their eyes, to turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they might receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and inheritance among them which are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Acts 26.18. See alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus. Here the Apoſtle maketh a plain Antitheſis between what they then were, &amp; what they had been formerly. <hi>Ye are waſhed,</hi> that is, cleanſed by the blood of Chriſt (which was ſignified by the water of your Baptiſme) both from the <hi>guilt,</hi> and <hi>ſtate</hi> of ſin, <hi>ye are ſanctified, ye are juſtified.</hi> Now make up the other part of the Antitheſis, and it muſt be this, Ye were <hi>unſanctified,</hi> ye were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified.</hi> And when was that? before they were converted, when they lived in ſuch ſins as are mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and 10. they were committers of them, and guilty before God, excluded from an actuall title to the Kingdome of God. Such were ſome of you; but ye are
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:119718:161"/> waſhed, <hi>&amp;c. Eph.</hi> 2. to ver. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.28. ch. 5.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Corol.</hi> 1.</note> that ſay Faith doth but manifeſt our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> may as well ſay it doth but manifeſt our <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> for they were both propoſed, purchaſed, and wrought together.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Sanctifying</hi> grace is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> qualification of a juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe Chriſt doth not beſtow theſe ſaving mercies ſeverally, but joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and individually; where his <hi>ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> grace is not communicated, his <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> is not imputed, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (even by ſanctifying grace wrought in us) we are to try our actuall intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Hence thoſe that are perplexed with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure, &amp; pinched with the want of grace, are to come to Chriſt for help in both kinds. Thoſe that ſay they dare not believe, nor lay hold upon the Promiſes, for the remiſſion of ſins, becauſe they are of unhumbled, and impenitent hearts, muſt learn to come to Chriſt, that their hearts may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and humbled: It is he that gives <hi>repentance</hi> unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as <hi>remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</hi>

               <p>The believing ſinner,<note place="margin">Prop. 6.</note> being juſtified
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:119718:162"/> from all the ſins that are paſt, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified inchoately: The pardon conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth good in Law, and the ſanctifying grace beſtowed, is conſerved by the ſame Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Corol.</note>Hence the Elect of God, though they many times fall to their ſore wounding, from the lively actings of grace, and under Gods juſt paternal diſpleaſure; yet they never fall from a ſtate of grace, and their heavenly Fathers affectionate love. <hi>Pſal</hi> 89 28. to 34. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Hence the godly are to pray daily for pardon of ſin, and power againſt it.<note place="margin">Corol.</note> Thus Chriſt taught his Diſciples to pray, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes— and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> And here note, that as in the fourth Petition he teacheth them, and us daily to pray for our daily ſuſtenance, ſo in theſe Petitions (which are adjoyned with a conjunction copulative) he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth daily to pray for daily forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and for daily preſervation againſt tentations. And it were far better for us to be a day without our daily Bread, than without our daily Pardoning, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and renewing grace. It is true, the Lord hath promiſed both, and will perform what he hath promiſed: yet <hi>thus ſaith the Lord, I will for this be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them,</hi> Ezek. 36.37.
